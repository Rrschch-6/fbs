so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
You are a helpful assistant. You should talk to",Be
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
