there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""draw refE1_15",D
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the one on the top left is",S
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so the pen needs to be",Be
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the idea is to have a",S
yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} The text ""you get quite a lot you",Be
draw angle,D,"{""label"": ""S""}.

Text: ""draw refE1_1",S
so we were talking mostly about that one or that one,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

that one sort of plus or minus,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and the other one is a",Be
all these you have to keep flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
its just its just whether we need flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the one that is the real main",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the pen has to be held in",S
yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} (from example)
Text: ""you do it",Be
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
and you would not have the angle problem,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yeah the problem is that printing on the ball,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,S
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",S
so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
we did that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The text ""they ll go cold again""",Bs
probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
but you can make it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
clears throat erm at the moment what we have got available for a demonstrator is one of the types on the left,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
so we do have this constraint of what that angle needs to be ,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
so that is going to,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
that angle here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yes that is going to limit us for the time being,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the pen could be a soldering",F
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
to keep the to hold on to rather than actual hands are stabilised like a platform,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
I mean it only moves in one axis,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
rather than round,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
it does not its almost flat is not it I suppose,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yeah it does not move that way I do not think,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
cos you want to keep flat on the paper all the time,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
does the razor stay flat though,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
because the centre piece is much,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

I am not sure whether it does completely stay flat I think there might be a little bit of a plain,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but its main axis is is that the razor has is that way I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
write razor,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
if I if I remember correctly from I don t know about this but from the other razors each blade has like a little spring down each side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
which means each blade can independently of housing can move that way a little bit as well cant it so that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

draw E1_7 Sketckjpg,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's see. The text here",D
how s that achieved that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

that is bendable or is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
no it s a spring is not it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}.
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S

there is f five of the razors is not there,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""there is f five of the",S
I have brought some examples along there is one with a single spring in the centre there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",S

Text: ""the pen is a thermal pen""",S
these are electric ones yeah,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

these are electric razors and so this is,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the pen is designed to draw",S
slightly more expensive version that is got a spring either side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down the text: """,Bs
yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
they do yeah there is its one with the foils basically because on this the foil is sprung this one is well no,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

the foil will run through rubbers and it uses the the cutting edge that is sprung,Bs,"Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text is: ""the foil",D
erm there is a point here,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Wait, the text is ""erm there is",Be
as well that erm do we need to keep because this will keep an even well a relatively constant pressure won t it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and you could also you could add a switch to this,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",S
so you could switch it on and off,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well because,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so the first thing that we",Be
it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it comes on how you want it to,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so is that what you call a gimble,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

gimbles are normally three dimensional,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the pen is held in the",S
I ve got another one,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
it builds on another one,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and it goes faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} Let's analyze the sentence ""and it goes faster",Be
but as well its erm one of the things about this is that you have got the main lump,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
and then you have got steering piece towards the front which is banging near microphone drowns speech,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Bs
so you have got,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""this one is the one that is",S
I guess you have kind of got the main unit that has got all the power and weight in it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and then erm the flexible bit that does the steering,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
where I know we re talking about a pen,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the pen is a thermal pen""",F
and you immediately think about something that is this sort of shape that you can hold in your hand like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} The text ""and you immediately think about something that",S
but considering we re talking about toys in effect for children,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
could it be something that takes more of the shape of a of a train with,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
something else that gets pulled behind it for example,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so that the pen can write",S
like a drag on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

something that is much more of a quite a different shape that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the one on the right the one",Be
does not require them to have that difficult sort of hold,Be,"Based on the provided text, let's analyze the label.

The text is",D
things in place like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
that is probably one of the things you want to teach a child though is not,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
yeah well you could take all of the difficult stuff off them and make it happen,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
all that they will do is move the lump around,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
write move lump,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
I was thinking a different media than just a flat piece of paper,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
a pens quite a nice sort of you know to get round angles and,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

do you think a mouse would allow you to apply that constant force that we need for this though,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
I don t see why not I mean as long as the force is not going to push the mouse into the table then gravity should be on your side should not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",Be
can I just clarify that you mean for the main lump to have all the sort of the weighty bits like the batteries and electronics and things like that or the that way,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
I was not really being that prescriptive,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

that is interesting cos I was thinking pastry brush you know how pastry has,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and white line machines,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Okay, let's break down the text:",Be
I guess this idea Tom was that this is the print head here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

well the distance between the rails and the what I was thinking the distance between the rails and the overhead wires always changing as it has to follow this articulating,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
yeah nice idea,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the other thing is that the",Be
it is a bit like the suspension on a car,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,Be

to because erm well I think well erm like this I say about this obviously it was not a problem,Be,"Based on the analysis, the text ""to because erm well I think well",D
if you do not if you do not let it gimble that way,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

well you could do that just electronically by activating one of the channels on the print heads,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and then you can actually print",Bs
write or do this electronically,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""but the main thing is",S
I think that is the way to do it because,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""but it is quite heavy""",Be
otherwise you can overheat the print head and might damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
so part of the thing here is we need to erm hold it down,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
otherwise it going to overheat as its firing if there is no where for the heat to go,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
could we put erm can we detect the heat that the,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and therefore switch it off,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
or know what s going on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
er that is only going to stop it getting dangerously hot,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
all we need to do for print quality and performance and things,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
is to keep those dots on the paper when they re being fired,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""is to keep those dots on",Bs
the other thing which you will picture sort of erm to an extent that one as well is the actual steering erm is actually,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
at the moment the hand steers it directly by making movements with the hand,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the pen is held in the",Be
but if you had like a joystick,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
that then moved the angle of the print head errm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
that might work too but maybe a bit more expensive I suppose,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  The text ""that might work too but maybe",Bs
I think the interesting thing is to use is as they steer that its built into the steering,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""I think the interesting thing is to",F
actually tilts the whole body as it steers,Bs,"Okay, let's tackle this. The text is ""actually tilts the",D
so in order to maintain that angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the pen needs to be designed",Be
write integrate the steering into angle like snowmobile,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""write integrate the steering into angle like",D
it compensates for the lean of the rider into the corner,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so it s flat,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so it s flat""
Label (",S
so if we had something like that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you could steer this angle of the pen as it moves to the other end,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""its taken us probably three places we",Be
or you take all the opportunities for control away from people apart from moving around,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
and you make the pen or whatever it is do everything,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
erm or we give some feedback erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so that people know when they re doing the right thing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
write feed back to user when doing it right,D,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
erm or the last one is it is possible to hold it the wrong way,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but it forces you to hold it the right way possibly base on shapes,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
write make the shape so it can only be done one way,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
well for the the third you can make it erm hard make it compliant to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""well for the the third you",F
I know I know what you re saying but it would be difficult,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
because you would overheat the edge of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
if its not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but there could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads overheating it must be touching at the other end,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Bs
so I shall switch this,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
yeah probably there must be some way of detecting that,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
can I just explore that last one in a little more detail,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the main idea is that the",Be
because when organisations,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} (based on the cues for Be: ""smooth",Be
making sure they can only be correct in one way so the design and shape of the thing,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
so it can only be done in one way and that s the correct way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
because then there is less sort of learning to be done by the user and children I think if they are you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
if they don t get the results pretty quickly they will just give up on it erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so it would be quite good shape of,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the pen has to be small",Be
it would only let it work in one particular way,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
you could build it in different ways so you could have it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so that there was only one way of doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
but then err you can have switches on it so that supposing supposing it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
you have got the print head and three balls around it to support it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
with pressure sensors on those balls,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""which will be in the pen",Bs
so if the child presses harder it activates all the bearings,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The sentence is",Bs
and prints out a very erm heavy line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the pen has a replaceable",Be
but if the child does not press hard then you activate every other one,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so you get a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
write interaction between how child presses so activation of print head,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so clears throat the actual kind of the erm the print head is isolated from what the child s doing,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
but the sensors,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and the sensors are in the tip",S
attend to what the child s doing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""but we need to be careful in",Be
and the thing responds accordingly,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and so you can trick the child into doing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,F
and you could also make it so that even if the child s because erm clears throat its not direct you can make it sort of software,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
so that even if the child s really uncoordinated basically you get a reasonable result,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but if the child s very coordinated you can actually do some quite sophisticated things,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you could even have sort of some feedback,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
in terms of colour LEDs on the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
saying that he s done a good or she s done a good job or,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is going to be used",Be
that is a bit that is a bit peachy I think somehow,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Wait, the text ""that is a bit",Be
yeah you know because i if they re doing something and it produces a result,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
that is what they want is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Okay, let's tackle this classification.",F
that is what they want and saying well done is not really you know so what,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""so the main thing is to",F
spirit level in the pen,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
3D spirit level the dot and the ring you the dot,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
write spirit level in the pen,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
if it goes off centre you know the dots outside the ring,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Bs
the pen would not work,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so you have got to come in,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so you have got to come in",Be
could we sorry could we actually see what they re doing I mean,F,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the pen has to be held",S
are they drawing pictures or making invitations or Christmas cards or,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""something else"" → Label:",F
as well as electronics,S,"{""label"": ""S""} Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and some of the control,F,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and user interface features and things whereas,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
erm this kind of functional end of the mechanics,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
it does affect a little bit,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}.

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
control draw,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah because its really hard to draw a picture with a mouse is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you could have games built into it could not you,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you could have something like colouring in,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the pen could be used",Be
could try and tell you on some screen,F,"{""label"": ""Be""} Let's analyze the text ""could try and",Be
or try some sort of coordination task,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
there is a huge amount of possibilities you could do mazes or anything with,F,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""and you have to have a",F
once more let us explore this spirit level in more detail I corrected the transcript,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
because the other thing that you use to make sure things are level,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""because the other thing that you",Be
that is come out in the sort of DIY world is these laser levellers and things like that if,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
you had like a little laser,S,"{""label"": ""S""} To determine the correct label for the text ""you",S
that made sure that it was level of some sort erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you know the child can actually see a line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} (Correct)
Text: ""you know the child",Be
and that its at the right angle then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
because they can see that the line is right and then that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
although maybe they are a bit young for that laugh,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} (I think this is Be because it refers to",Be
you could project something onto the paper in front of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down the sentence: """,Bs
write Laser level,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",D
like dam busters,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
write Dam busters shine a light in front of,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
just like star wars,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
erm I was going to say an optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""but the idea is that the pen",S
I was going to say an optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
if you lift it off the page you can,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
actually see its got the pattern it creates separates into two areas,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so its when it s actually on the surface two points meet,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
if you lift an optical mouse,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",Be
slightly off the page you will see the pattern it creates,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
yeah sort of the triangle thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,S
is in two sort of distinct spots,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""is in two sort of distinct spots",S

Okay, let's break down the sentence: """,Bs
write use optical mouse mechanism,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""write use a laser"" → {""",D
turn the light on I don t know how to operate,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah well if you left it a few minutes,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
when you talked about the little light in front of the erm pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
but if there is sort of feedback from the print head to know its in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
and then the light goes on only but only when the print head is on there is this little light comes on,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and then the light goes on",Bs
so the child gets his feedback that way oh its in the right direction so I can draw,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
I think if I was in their shoes using this I d prefer they d be something where I decide whether its in the right position,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break down the text:",Be

Okay, let's tackle this labeling task.",Be
that kind of thing,S,"Okay, let's tackle this. The text is ""that kind of thing",D
well there is a bit of training there is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} To determine the correct label for the text ""well",Be
write Light,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

true but it its kind of patronising to have these sort of lights,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
its not a comforting a comforting noise,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be

you do have to hold in a certain orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yeah I think that is what I tried its really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
because I don t hold my pen in the way that they expect you do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
they expect you to some people write like this don t they,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""they expect you to some people",Be
that is what I join my fingers up at the top where as that one expects that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
you do more of that which I don t do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
that is because you did not have that pen when you were little,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Okay, let's see. The text is """,S
that are really hard to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the other ideas",Be

Text: ""the pen is a thermal pen""",S
to use straight up and down otherwise they don t otherwise they don t work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  (correct)
Text: ""to use straight",Be
because they work thr they th they re like a little er tube,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
and when you push on it erm it opens a valve which lets the erm which lets the ink through,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback s inherent is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Be
if you re not doing it properly it wont work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
it will probably it will probably be that if you do it on the edge,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the PCB,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Bs
and you ll lift the whole the whole thing off,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and then you can you can",Be
so you probably wont be able to do this this sort of touch towards the edge,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
because the print head the resistors are in,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task.",S

just the kind of thing that you could do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
with the erm styling,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so it just feels right you not do you are limited to what you can do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

if you put your fingers in the wrong place,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task.",Be

and this thing could go in the hole this lot could go in the hole,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
and perhaps you can mirror it so it works for left handed people as well,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be

can you turn the print head round or,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

you have to keep the area of the mirror image,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
quite good,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  ????
Text: ""very good""
Label",Be
in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it is not even a pen,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
because a pen you you will always learn to write from left to right whether you re left handed or right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so actually what you end up doing is left handed people is you smudge over over your work which is a problem,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

but actually with this you re dragging it you re not pushing it are you most people will drag it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} I think the label for the text ""but actually",Be

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
if you re left handed you push,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so do they do a left handed version of this,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
that s more interesting cos commercially lost that would be a loss leader just about,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
well it must it must cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
its gonna cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down the text """,Bs

erm protecting the print head which I haven t really thought very much about,F,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
to have the print head projecting down out of the bottom of this most of the time,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
well there is potential for a safety issue,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
that you have been in contact with can be a very hard thing to do erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be

Text: ""the pen is able to detect that",S
or holding station or something,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""or something that is a holding",S
cos it could be sold as it could be a thing you put your special media on or,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
and we could either detect that,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,S

write translucent dots,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

you can only write on a magnetic plate is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah you could do that or looking for a signal or,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
or detecting a change,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so this is what you re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

errr yeah its more systemy,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
I guess beyond the actual pen you could imagine all sorts of systems where,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
mmm ok you re tied you re tied to the media anyway so it s not really,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the main idea is that you",S
erm yeah you re probably not constrained,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
because you unless you are detecting something special about the media which you might want to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

the effects of the media then it would work on any thermal media or,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
that is not common is it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
like printers,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
fax machines,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the mechanism might look like,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"Based on the analysis, the text describes a structural feature of a device,",D
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the main thing is that the",Be
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""to hold the pen at the",Bs
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Wait, the user",Bs
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Okay, let's break down the text:",Bs
they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Okay, let's tackle this classification.",S
the outside bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah the thing that we did a few years ago,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
which had a kind of sort of forced balanced print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Bs
we tend to do fairly wide print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
to try and keep them in contact with the medium,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

it s like the old tape recorders is not it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

what you always want to combine is something that when you press you press media,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

brilliant idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}?

you could do it with one switch,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is",S
if if the casework say the casework is comes out f further out errm ,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""then the pen would be more stable",S
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""if you what it does is you",Be
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Be
the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text is ""the case comes",D
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so that so that when it it does not actually erm,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""but it s actually the opposite",Be
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}.
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
draws,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""draws"" → Label: Bs",Bs
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""but it is a bit of a",S
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so that the pen can write on",F
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The sentence is",Bs
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text is: ""because what",D
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the pen has to be able",Be
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",S
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and the other thing is the",Bs
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",F
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""hand is on the left it s",S
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""S""} I think the label for the text ""it would",S
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so the pen is designed to",S
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",F
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""is that handed"" → Label",S
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} (Correct label is Be, as the text refers",Be
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""It needs to print legibly at",Be
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} (correct)
Text: ""and you have to",Bs
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break down the text:",Be
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so the pen needs to be",Be
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Wait, let me think again. The text",F
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Okay, let's tackle this classification.",Be
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and you have got the type where",Be
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Be
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",Bs
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}.
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",S
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""there is a few of those is",S
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""S""} The text ""there is a switch there"" refers",S
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so that the pen can write",Be
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""a certain tolerance it works""",Be
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""S""} According to the guidelines, the text ""you",S
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}.
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,S
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""or a thermal pen""
Label",Be
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} (the user's answer)

But according to the",Be
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",D
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so there is a minimum travel",Be
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the pen is a thermal pen",S
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
but if its too far out it wont be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",Be
because its erm not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",S
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
because they don t touch this outer angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break down the text:",S
but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
you could just stick it on a on a rubbery pack or a film,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",S
sketching spring,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
I er,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Okay, let's see. The text is just",D
they start doing this sheath that hits first,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Bs
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Bs
so you can t do it quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so you can t do it",Be
so you can t shock that thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and the other thing is that",Bs
that ll slo slow down and then it will slowly move back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yeah but then when you erm take it off the paper it quickly pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""the pen is actually quite light",Bs
because this is a one way valve,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
they will be air in there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so that spring quickly returns it back down to it s protective position,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Bs
so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The text ""so bang it down its protected force",Bs
but as soon as you take it off it pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down the sentence:",Bs
so its just good point actually clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} Let's analyze the text ""so its just good",Be
I was just thinking that relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down the sentence: """,Bs
so if we moves it round masks speech contact with the surface,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
its going to have quite a bit of momentum still so erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
quite hard or something that its pressed onto,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The sentence",Be
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The text ""or it could hinge forward under its",Bs

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text",Bs
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Be
yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
no well as I say you need to shock that down ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
you re smash you re gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath before this does anything in here,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down the sentence:",Bs
yeah also they re not that made out of ceramic and glass,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
mmm I think that is I think that the other other protective thing,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
is whether they smash it off the table before momentum,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} (from the examples given, this seems to be",Be
It s not it s not really kids sort of erm err throwing,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""It s not it s not",S
it down its also people dropping it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break down the text:",Be
then you can smash the edge of this,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""the one on the right does",Bs
cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it so,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
or whatever that we could perhaps achieve holding this thing flat to the surface,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
the foam pads is an idea actually you could imagine,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
a foam pad with an aluminium carrier on the front of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",S
and the print head fastened to that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and it can just squidge around,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
so yeah that would work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
it would also give you some a really cheap way,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so that you can use",S
of achieving a reasonable force,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

a great density foam,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
that could give you the force of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
it could just recoil far enough it s a good idea actually,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} Let's analyze the sentence: ""it could just",Be
that could work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} (based on the example where ""could work""",Be

I reck I reckon you move it around,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} Alright, let's tackle this labeling task. The",Be
yeah well you put this,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
and it will just erm you have got spring and you have got some lovely,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and it will just erm you",S
could you even take that one further,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""well that would be a very",Be
like you could build the foam around the print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so you d have to press the foam back to actually reveal the print head in the first place,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
so it almost wraps round a little bit,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

so if you go like that bang the foam needs to,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break down the text: """,Be
perhaps not wrapped around to the extend in front of the housing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
bit in before you actually start touching it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
to do some damping,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

what is the range of angles,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""what is the range of angles""",Be
it s just to measure what you what the parameters are,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""and we need to think about how",F
if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is",S
like a millimetre or so,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""this is a bit of a problem",Be
that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The sentence",F
that is easier to use,Bs,"Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text is ""that is easier",D
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so the pen has to be",S
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""so the pen would have to",Bs
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Bs
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so you could continue to drag",Be
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the force is in the middle",Be
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The text is """,S
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""that means this sort of thing",Bs
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The sentence",Bs
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and we can print thermo reactive d",S
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""another five hundred grams"" →",S
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""erm but most the value in the",S
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The text is",Be
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Bs
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""well only if its yeah but",Be
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the sheath is the part of",S
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so the pen needs to be",S
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""well is there anything else""",Be
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The",S
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the pen would be in the",S
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""but we need to make it light",S
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",S
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The",Be
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",S
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""so the thing is that the",Be
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Alright, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Be
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} Let's analyze the text: ""the friction between",Bs
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",Bs
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text is: ""or something",D
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this classification. The text",F
