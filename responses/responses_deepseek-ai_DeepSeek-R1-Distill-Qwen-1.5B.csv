To determine the label, consider the following:

hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding thing to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

Let's see, I'm a bit stuck on",D
so technically the stuff where you have got a low percentage fill sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Okay, I need to figure out how to",D

whether we could do that with this adaptation I don t know,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels for each segment, I need to",D

To determine the label, you need to analyze the text",D
it could be a soldering iron,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine this, select one label from [",D

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Okay, I need to figure out the label",D
whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 

What is the label for this text?

there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the appropriate label",D
this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
Let's think step by step how to approach",D
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I need to figure out the label for the",D
so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""but its also about the media""",S
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for this",D
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you need to consider the following",D
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine this, identify the label(s)",D
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, let me try to figure this out. So",D
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine this, you should consider the given text",D
is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

the sledge is er quite broad,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, the text may contain multiple segments",D

based on the idea of a sledge,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Your answer is worth 6 points

yeah no problem stabilisers like a bicycle yeah that is a good idea,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to analyze this text and assign",D
write stabiliser,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out what label to",D
I was thinking that is sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, let's see. The text is",D
no its not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context of the",D
it ll be about fifty percent more expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, consider the text and the",D
yes this there is an end,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, so I need to figure out the correct label",D
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

Text: ""so it is a type that",D
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""...""} 
To determine the label, consider the context of",D
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, first determine whether the text contains",D
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out what label to",D
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""___""}

yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine your answer, need to use the labeled",D
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Wait, no, the first part is a bit",S
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" }

{""label"": ""Be",Be
draw circle draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""...""}

draw box draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Okay, so I need to figure out which",D
I think that picture where you re moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, use the provided instructions and examples",D
instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just do a thin line at a time,Bs,"{""label"": ...}

To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

would build up and use that tracking capability to do that,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Okay, let's try to understand the problem",D

To determine the label, consider the following:

The text ""yeah the problem is",D
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To find the label, first determine the label type:",D
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Text: ""I have a lot of the",D

we did that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

with the dots though very very small,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

What should the label be for the text: """,D
you can only they ve got such low they will last thermal mass,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should look at the text and",D
you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, look for cues in the",D
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text and the given",D
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D

then you add a feature by taking out you know,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

otherwise you can overheat the print head and might damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

is to keep those dots on the paper when they re being fired,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

actually tilts the whole body as it steers,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

To determine the label, consider the text and the definitions",D
if its not touching,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Text: ""the one on the top left",D
but there could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads overheating it must be touching at the other end,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, first, analyze the text and",D
so I shall switch this,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Text: ""the other ideas on the paper",D

making sure they can only be correct in one way so the design and shape of the thing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

if they don t get the results pretty quickly they will just give up on it erm,Be,"{""label"": ""...""} 

And another text: ""the paper is thin",D

To determine the label, consider the following:

To determine the label, consider the text, and decide",D

To determine the label, choose the one with the highest",D

Text: ""so its the interaction between the",D
if I run upstairs I have got one of those in my drawer,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, use the instructions and the",D
there are pens that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Let's see, the text is ""there are pens",D
you do have to hold in a certain orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules",D
yeah I think that is what I tried its really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach",D
because I don t hold my pen in the way that they expect you do,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, determine which label it is",D
they expect you to some people write like this don t they,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

The expected behaviour is that when a person writes",Be
that is what I join my fingers up at the top where as that one expects that,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, I need to analyze the",D
you do more of that which I don t do,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, consider the following:

- For",D
that is because you did not have that pen when you were little,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the labels, consider the following rules:",D
if you had had it you would write in the right way rather that the wrong,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you would do it properly,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you get inking pens,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

Your answer is worth 10 points",D
that are really hard to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you need to consider the context",D
because they look they look like little erm they they they go straight down like that sketching,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, I should look at",D
draw Document E1_3Sketcjjpg,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
you could have thumb holes or something like that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, use the labels and the allowed labels",D
this this this one that is this one has sort of that sort of thing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it does not force you to use it but it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the correct label for",D
helps you,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text and the provided",D
print heads,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine this, consider the following:

-",D
to use straight up and down otherwise they don t otherwise they don t work,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" }

To solve this problem, I need",D
because they work thr they th they re like a little er tube,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, consider the following:
- The label",D
and when you push on it erm it opens a valve which lets the erm which lets the ink through,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, we should analyze the text and see",D
is that those gold and silver type things,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to break down the text",D
that people use for making cards,Bs,"{""label"": ""_____""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
no it s like you get them for erm drafting pens,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

The answer should be concise and without extra information.",D
I think work like that they have got they re like that,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine this, the label should be chosen",D
because they they come in different bits of tube,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
Text: ""so it is a real important",D
and they give you a very accurate width of line,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
Text: ""the one on the top left is",D
OK but you cannot you cannot use them in any orientation,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you have to use in straight up and down,BS,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

The text",D
and so if you put it on the edge the you would go on the edge of the tube,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
and it just it would just sort of it just the edge just goes on,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine this, you should consider the context and",D
you will never get it you just crease the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

To classify the given text, we",D
the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback s inherent is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""S""}",S
if you re not doing it properly it wont work,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it will probably it will probably be that if you do it on the edge,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the PCB,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this problem, I need to determine the appropriate",D
and you ll lift the whole the whole thing off,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, choose the best fit according",D
so you probably wont be able to do this this sort of touch towards the edge,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

Okay, so I need to figure out the",D
because the print head the resistors are in,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 

The options are: F, Be, Bs",Bs
PCB yeah,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
- The",D
just the kind of thing that you could do,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context of the",D
with the erm styling,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so it just feels right you not do you are limited to what you can do,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

if you put your fingers in the wrong place,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and if we cut all that for I mean this version,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Alright, I need to figure out the correct",D
it could be much chunkier,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Now, let's think about how to approach",D
and this thing could go in the hole this lot could go in the hole,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
</think>

The text ""and this thing could go",D
and perhaps you can mirror it so it works for left handed people as well,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
but you could just make a hole to hold it in either way,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

1.",D
you d have to certainly with the first go realize where to put their fingers,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

Your answer should be 100%",D
it might not even work,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
if one of their fingers is not in the right hole,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, consider the following:",D
also you feed it back to the wrist,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
there is all different things,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
yeah hand sizes as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, so I need to figure out the label",D
you know you could you feed it back,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so its kind of like a watch or something on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you need to look for clues in",D
well you could have a battery pack in that could not you,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the correct label, consider the following:

The",D
or a rucksack,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
- if",D
or a rucksack laugh,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you must follow the instructions above",D
laugh ghostbusters,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to classify the given text into one",D
write battery pack on wrist,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
To classify: ""write battery pack on wrist""

The",D
write mould the unit to right position for,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
Text: ""so it's write mould the unit to",D
if you have got if you have got a switch there there there and there,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the labels, consider the following:

-",D
draw Document E1_4Sketcjjpg crosses indicate position of switchs,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, you may need to make assumptions",D
and it only works if all four switches are down,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, choose the one that best fits",D
and those switch positions guarantee that the head is down then,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Alright, I need to classify the given text",D
yeah that is the control approach is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

To classify the given text, we",D
yeah that is the yeah and you design it in such a way that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

that is a reasonably comfortable position,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, consider the following:
- If the",D
and if you don t put it in that position,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the given text",D
it does not work,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To get started, I will write a quick note:",D
it d be nice though if you naturally pick it up and it works,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, use the rules above.

The options",D
yeah but that is you can do the two together can you,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

The text",D
the other thing to to think about is in almost all cases when I look at pens the apart from re wired sort of micropens,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, first determine the main idea of",D
the th tip is actually the narrowest part of the product,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Your answer is worth 7 points
Okay,",D
whereas in what we re looking at it could actually be as wide or wider,S,"{""label"": ""_____""}
Okay, so I need to figure out the label",D
so its more like a paintbrush is not it like a DIY paintbrush,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

Okay, so I need to figure out the",D
it s more like a roller like a roller yeah,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, use the above guidelines and the",D
its there is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

To determine your answer, consider the following:",D
if you had like if you if you had it connected to one side like that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the given text",D
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to consider the context",D
or a it would be here the print head you could have then going to there then going to there is,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

The answer should be concise and without extra information",D
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by",D
that you don t smudge it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text as a whole",D
it would have flexibility because of the metal on which it s hinged if you like,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
Let's see, I need to find the",D
yeah I think actually I wonder if you intuitively know how to use a roller,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Your answer is worth 12 points",D
because you re older than eleven and intuitive if you have never seen it before,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

Your answer is worth 10 points.",D
my two year old rolls paints,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I will first analyze the text",D
but I think it could be the pen I mean it could be we could shape it so it does make it like a finer tip,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I'm a bit new to this, but",D
yeah but there is an inherent size issue with holding it this way is not there,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Text: ""we need to make sure that",D
because you re not going to have you you you used to have these pens that were ginormous and,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Wait, the first example in the problem says",D
it had lots of different pens inside it,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

And another text:

Text: ""the paper",D
yeah and they re all like this round,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label",D
and it made it really difficult to write with at the right angle,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so I think there is an issue about how big or how,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Wait, the user provided a text and wants",D
big,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Text: ""big""
Label (JSON only): {""",D
you might not hold it,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

Okay, let's understand the problem. We",D
yeah I think that is worth considering it actually,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
the not having it in a pen shape,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, the following are given:

To determine the label, consider the text as a whole",D
but actually holding it in a different way like that or,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Text: ""the paper is being used in",D
yeah there are two there are two sides to this I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, think about the text's",D
either you want to teach children to hold a pen properly,F,"{ ""label"": ""...""}
To classify: F, Be, Bs, S",S
if you wanted to do that you d give them a,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
The text is: ""if you wanted to do that",D
yeah but you have got to be taught how to hold a pen,F,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, the text is labeled as F,",F
a lot better as write like this as well,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine the label, consider the following:",D
different people will write,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

they should not be allowed,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following: the text",D
is it a training aid or toy that we re is it for fun,F,"{""label"": ""...""}

its for fun,F,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the answer, consider the following:

-",D
its mainly really for fun really I think erm,F,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, I need to figure out what label to",D
because if you want to teach a child something about pens,F,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to determine the correct label for",D
you d give them a pen would not you,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
no well it depends it could be funit could teach you something,F,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
its going to be quite a fat lump probably,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To find the labels, use the labels list above and",D
so it s not going to be that kind of pen that you use in future,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, select the appropriate label from the",D

Alright, so I need to figure out how to",D
so that if you hold it with your index finger actually through this,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

can you turn the print head round or,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

it does not matter because as long as you have got as long as you have got features that can be either mirrored features the same on each side,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

you have got them all like that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the context, the presence",D
you have got some area to work with and then,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
The answer should be within ...

you have to keep the area of the mirror image,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

To determine your answer, consider the following:",D
quite good,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it is not even a pen,F,"{""label"": ""...""}

so actually what you end up doing is left handed people is you smudge over over your work which is a problem,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

but actually with this you re dragging it you re not pushing it are you most people will drag it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To find the label, look for the dominant behaviour or",D
mostly dragging it,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, consider the following:",D
mmm because you were wired to drag it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

The task is to assign one label per segment.",D
that is an interesting point,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, consider the following:",D

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
when you re writing you re not actually dragging usually apart from if you re right handed,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

so do they do a left handed version of this,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",D
that s more interesting cos commercially lost that would be a loss leader just about,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

well they had that in my school when I was in primary school everybody had a red fountain pen and I had a special green fountain pen because I was left handed,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine this, you should consider the labels and the",D
they ll spring back and then they will switch on the,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you need to analyze the text and",D
that is true that works as well,Bs,"{label: ...}

To classify the text, I need to analyze the",D
it is sort of like a its like a calligraphy pen is not it if you erm,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I need to figure out the label for the",D
because you get thick you get thick and thin,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

What is the correct label for the text: """,D
that business of withdrawing the print head when it s not in use or something like that,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for the",D
well yeah well it s a sheath is not it that is the word you said was not it a sheath that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

the button,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Alright, let's tackle this problem step by",D
then it could not get lost could it,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 

Alright, I need to figure out the label",D
mmm it could also turn off the comforting hum,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}
Alright, I need to figure out the correct",D
when you put the cap back on,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

draw,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Wait, I'm getting a bit confused. Let",S
and then you could also have the same spring here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you need to analyze the text and",D
that any force by a certain amount would force the cap to shut again,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
yeah push the button then it goes open,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:",D
write garage door type mechanism,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you should consider the given text",D

but then regardless of whether you have got the button pressed down or not you press hard and it comes back down,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
so it does not matter if you drag it thuds hand on table it ll just,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Okay, so I need to apply this labeling guide",S
or you just keep that button pressed but,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, let's try to figure out how to",D
thud yeah if you re very sort of cover that comes down,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 

Okay, so I need to figure out",D
are you just whacking this pen there,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""but the main idea is that the",D
it s got a cap on,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

yeah is that refillable,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, consider the text provided",D
like this is not refillable,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules",D
I assume it has a cover that comes on as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
that is nice it s erm holdable,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules",D
so one one pence two pence six pence,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the following:",D
twenty pence,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
- For",D
you could put a time delay on it,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""S""}",S
write time delay,D,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, consider the text provided.",D
you could say it has to be in contact with the paper for a second and then the thing will deployed,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To solve this problem, I need to analyze each segment",D
it has a home so a docking station,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Let's see the examples to understand better.

To solve",D
we could charge it in there as well plus,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""} 
Let's see the text: ""we could charge",D
it might be over budget,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the context of the sentence",D

To determine the label, you should use the allowed",D
but detecting the media or detecting that you re on some kind of media,Bs,"{""label"": """"}
To determine this, you should consider the following:

The",D
or holding station or something,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
cos it could be sold as it could be a thing you put your special media on or,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label",D
and we could either detect that,Be,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Wait, the user provided a specific text to",D
or we could look for erm translucent dots buried in the erm media or something,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should look for... (ex",D
write translucent dots,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out the label for",D
or you could they you could a they could be like er beads switches,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, consider the following:

- Each",D
you can only write on a magnetic plate is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, use the following rules:

1.",D
yeah you could do that or looking for a signal or,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

First",D
or detecting a change,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so this is what you re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, consider the text above",D
errr yeah its more systemy,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
Okay, I need to figure out how to",D
I guess beyond the actual pen you could imagine all sorts of systems where,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for the",D
mmm ok you re tied you re tied to the media anyway so it s not really,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

What is the correct label for the text: """,D
erm yeah you re probably not constrained,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

- First",D
because you unless you are detecting something special about the media which you might want to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
the effects of the media then it would work on any thermal media or,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for the",D
that is not common is it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, I need to figure out the correct label",D
like printers,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I need to figure out how to assign labels",D
fax machines,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

- The",D
I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the mechanism might look like,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Let's see the examples.

Okay, I need",D
the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""...""} 
Text: ""the thermal pen is the real",D
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for",D
in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, consider the following:

- The text",D
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:

-",D
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and then they could stay,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
do they really need to stay in contact well,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

The text ""do they really need to stay",D
if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

And also another text:

Text: ""the paper",D
edge and if you go over it if you come too high an angle,Be,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 

Your Answer

</think>

{""label"": """,D
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine your answer, consider the following:
-",D
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",S
but what you cant do is it can t the print head can t tilt back or forward because these slots are in,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
this this stays at a fixed angle,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Your answer is worth 7 points
To",D
it can move up and down,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Alright, I need to figure out how to",D
and side to side its fixed that way,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

- First",D
the print head relative to the pen,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 
Let's see the examples.

Okay, so",D
I am sorry I am just thinking about I think there is probably a geometry that could do it with just one switch erm,S,"{""label"": ...}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
that when you come too far over erm the pen starts moving back in and so back in,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, the following are given:

The",D
and therefore the switch comes off,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
before it looses contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, consider the following rules:

- """,D
you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the correct label for",D
the outside bit,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Okay, let's try to figure out the",D
yeah the thing that we did a few years ago,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",S
which had a kind of sort of forced balanced print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Text: ""the paper had a kind of",D
we tend to do fairly wide print heads,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the text as a",D
to try and keep them in contact with the medium,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

To try and keep them in contact with the",D
it appears a bit different less controlled,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out the label for",D
and on that we basically had a frame,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, you need to analyze the text",D
which brought the print head down brought the print head down,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, use the following rules:

First",D
and then that is right and so,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context and the",D
like this and then,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

The user wants to know the label for the",D
it s like the old tape recorders is not it,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, consider the following:

- Identify",D
it finds its own level,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and the force is applied to this,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, consider the context of the",D
that is right the print head just like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

The print",D
on a carrier as well,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine this, the labels are to be assigned",D
could it work this way as well,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, you should consider the following rules",D
no,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
what you always want to combine is something that when you press you press media,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
so that you have made contact,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out the correct label",D
circuit you over pressurise it,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Okay, let's try to understand this.",D
and it goes past it,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

<think>
Okay, I need to figure out",D
so it does not work and then you have got you have got bottom out,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

- If",D
sheath here,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

What is the correct label for the text """,D
brilliant idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:

Text",D
and could you use these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Text: ""the one on the top left",D
and put them in 3D,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following: 'and",D
could be one could be one here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:

1",D
and there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
we only need two in the front and back,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Alright, I need to figure out the correct",D
so that as well as being in the right vertical position ie actually touching paper,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, but the label set is F,",S
so that it dissipates heat not press too far,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, you should consider the context",D
because then it pops out the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context of the",D
and you re over pressurising it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Wait, but the problem is to assign one",D
but also something to do with the fact that these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Let me think step by step about how to approach this",D
if if as you say go over an angle then you notice that central thing comes away from one side,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, first, determine the type",D
you know the distances between the edge of these ,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
the distance between the edges of these things and the outer casing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you must first identify the text",D
when you re at a small angle,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
they move a little bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
when you re at a big angle,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:

First",D
one sides hard up against it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

The first",D
the other one produces a gap and so you can almost have that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine your answer, you should use the instructions",D
could you have that front and back as well like a sort of cross,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, select one label from [F,",F
and then you have to have all four things contacted like what you said earlier so,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

Your answer is worth 6 points.
To",D
because they re on a spring and then you have got your central four points,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
Okay, I need to determine the correct label",D
here this is going to be up then if you go in that planeover an angle too much ,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine the label, first determine which label",D
my arg what I was trying to say before is erm,S,"{""label"": """"}
To determine the labels, use the allowed labels and the",D
you could do it with one switch,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
if if the casework say the casework is comes out f further out errm ,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following: 
-",D
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
</think>

To determine the appropriate label for the text",D
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, you must use the guide above",D
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""so its the interaction between the special",D
but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
- If",D
the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you should consider the cues in",D
so that so that when it it does not actually erm,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the text provided and",D
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I need to figure out the correct label for",D
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, choose the most appropriate from",D
draws,D,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, think about the context",D
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Text: ""the one on the top left",D
will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{label: ...}

Text: ""the other ideas on the paper there were",D
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 
The switch is designed with a tolerance factor.",D
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Text: ""the paper is going to be",D
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the text and",D
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine your answer, consider the following:",D
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, think about the text, and",D
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine if the label is F, Be,",Be
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
}

So, the task is to assign labels to the",D
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for the",D
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the given examples and",D
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine this, consider the following:

- The",D
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, I need to figure out the label for",D
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the following:

-",D
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""___""}

To determine the appropriate label for the text",D
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

Alright, I need to figure out",D
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for",D
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I need to figure out how to assign the",D
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to determine which label applies",D
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

The text is: ""but I think you certainly",D
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I'm going to take a deep breath and",D
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}
Okay, I need to figure out how to",D
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context of",D
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}

To determine your answer, consider the following:",D
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

Okay, let's try to figure out how",D
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, I'm a bit stuck. Let's",D
but it s,S,"{""label"": """"}
To determine if the label is correct, you need to",D
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Wait, the user provided a sample text and the",D

Wait, the user wants me to generate a",D
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Text: ""switching the if you if",D
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

To determine this, you should consider the context in",D

To determine the label, consider the context of the sentence",D

{""label"": ""S""}",S
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you should consider the text and",D
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the correct label, I'll start by analyzing",D

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you need to analyze the text and",D
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

The text mentions edges but does not",D
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To find the label, first determine the label according to",D

could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:

Text: ""the main idea is that the",D
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you must analyze the text and",D

To determine the label, you should analyze the text and",D
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text as a whole",D
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

The text ""so it can t",D
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and then sort of smash onto something,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, you need to consider the",D
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I will look for the presence",D
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" }
</think>

The text ""protected the",D
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out what label to",D
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

Text: ""the one on the top left",D
yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

The text",D
no well as I say you need to shock that down ,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze",D
you re smash you re gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath before this does anything in here,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}
Okay, so I have this text: """,D
yeah also they re not that made out of ceramic and glass,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, let's try to figure out how to approach",D
mmm I think that is I think that the other other protective thing,F,"{""label"": ""_______""}
To determine the labels, consider the following:",D
is whether they smash it off the table before momentum,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
It s not it s not really kids sort of erm err throwing,Be,"{""label"": ""...""} 

But let me think step by step about this",D
it down its also people dropping it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text above and the",D
yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard,Be,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
Text: ""the one on the top left",D
yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

Okay, so I need to determine which label",D
then you can smash the edge of this,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze",D
cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it so,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine your answer, consider the following:

<think>
Okay, let's try to figure out",D
so yeah that would work,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",S
it would also give you some a really cheap way,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
that could work,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, let's try to understand the problem.",D
a big sponge,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 

What is the correct label for ""a big sponge",D
draws,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you should consider the text as",D
aluminium print head on the bottom all connected,D,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out how to assign labels",D
I reck I reckon you move it around,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the labels, consider the context of the sentence",D
yeah well you put this,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""so its the interaction between the special paper",D
and it will just erm you have got spring and you have got some lovely,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
-",D
could you even take that one further,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Text: ""so it's important to make sure",D
like you could build the foam around the print head,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

- The",D
so you d have to press the foam back to actually reveal the print head in the first place,Be,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" }

Okay, I need to figure out",D
so it almost wraps round a little bit,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following: the text",D
so if you go like that bang the foam needs to,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}

<think>
Alright, let's break down this",D
perhaps not wrapped around to the extend in front of the housing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

so that you know you need to press the foam,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, use the following rules:

- First",D
bit in before you actually start touching it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the context of the text",D

{""label"": ""F""}",F
to do some damping,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To do some damping is a process aimed at reducing the",D
so that is got to go somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, consider the following:

yeah you need the foam to have tha that sort of this sort of,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for this",D
where where it does not want to move fast,Be,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" }

Okay, so I need to figure",D
well has to be down,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

The text ""well has to be",D
we could we could have some sort of air bladder,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, so I need to determine the correct label",D
I think it probably could be rubber,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, I need to figure out what label to assign",D
obviously,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so it's""
Label (JSON",D
yeah the stuff they make wrist supports for erm,S,"{""label"": ""______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
yeah well gel does that,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

<think>
Alright, I need to determine the",D
yeah techno gel,S,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" } 

Now, let's think about",D
the only p gel,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

The text ""you could make a",D
pellets,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I will analyze the text and look",D
so it stays sort of stays,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Let's see... The text is ""so it stays",D
pushed into it yeah you could do something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to classify the given text into one",D
magnets not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

{""label"": ""S""}",S
air pockets are much cheaper,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

well that does not have to be that could be a balloon inside,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text given.
To",D
yeah you could put a it on a pneumatic bladder in,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text.

Okay,",D
yeah or like a sort of bridge,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
or you could do what they do in an old fashioned mouse not optical mouse,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
To determine the label, first determine whether the",D
with the b ball,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Now, according to the examples, the correct",D
just use gravity because it s own weight makes it roll on the mouse mat,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to classify the given text into one",D
that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to determine the correct label",D
five hundred grams is that wh is that the,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

oh you need five hundred grams OK that is fi,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the correct label, you must consider the context",D
you need five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",S
how far s five hundred grams,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Okay, I need to figure out the label",S
er er yeah if you take it to twenty mill,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Wait, no, the user provided a specific",D
sort of half the compression that will be,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

{""label"": ""F""}",F
I did not realise what this was this is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Text: ""the one on the top left is the",D
it s a prototype model,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text and the instructions",D
it s not really a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

But according to",D
well its test,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

<think>
Alright, let's break down the problem",D
to explore,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To explore"" is a sentence that I need to label",D
why do you need that force,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the label for the",D
err expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to determine what kind of",D
for contact is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
- Check",D
well if you well if you well if you have got heat here,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the text given and",D
and here its zero contact is not it,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, let's try to understand the problem and",D
yeah so you need quite a strong contact basically,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, use the provided guidance.
</think>",D
well if you have got a so if you go to ten mils instead of five,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
well then you re going to have a,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the given text",D
a switch on,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""the switch is on""
Label (JSON",D
that is what one of the questions was the other switch goes past there we want to wa,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Alright, let me try to figure this out",D
one you re inside the protective thing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context of the",D

To determine the correct label for the",D
yeah it will be like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
but its very similar,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""so it's very similar""
Label (",D
it s just for the skilled personnel to use in their lab,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the context and the presence",D
the print quality in a way,Bs,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
what is the range of angles,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it s just to measure what you what the parameters are,S,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 

Text: ""so it is so much better",D
if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Text: ""so its the interaction between the special",D
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""} 

Text: ""so what s quite important is its",D
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, let's try to tackle this problem step by",D
like a millimetre or so,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, so I need to figure out what label",D
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the following:",D
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, first determine if the text",D
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

-",D
that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
The text is labeled as ""S"" because it's",S
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
Okay, so I need to figure out the label for",D
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you should look for the best",D
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the context and the structure",S
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the given text",D
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

- The",D
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the context of",D
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""_______""}
Text: ""the one on the top left",D
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the standard thermal paper""
Label (",S
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
- First",D
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{label: ...}

Text: ""the paper is very thin and smooth,",D
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine this, you should consider the following:",D
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""______""}

To classify the text ""you have",D
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""______""}

And another text:

Text: ""the paper",D
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

The text ""and provide an extra five hundred",D
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, you need to analyze the text",D
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""______""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
Let's see... the first sentence: ""then you",D
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, consider the following:
-",D
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you need to analyze the text and",D
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text and the provided",D
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, think about the following:

-",D
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the text and",D
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Alright, I need to figure out the correct label for",D
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

The text is in the context of F–",F
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine if a label is correct, I need",D
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""___""}
To solve this, I need to determine which label",D
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the text and",D
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so its the interaction between the special",S
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": """"}
To classify the following text:

""the paper is going",D
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

Okay, I need to figure out what label",D
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to analyze the given text",D

yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""...""} 

The user provided a data set of 10",D
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""...""}

To determine the label, I need to analyze the",D
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

The text in the problem is: ""its apparently",D
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}

Alright, let's go through the text and determine",D
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text.
To determine",D
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
To determine the label, consider the following:

if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the labels F,",F
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the text above.

In",D
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
Let's start by breaking down the problem.

We have",D
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, consider the context of the sentence",D
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""} 

What is the correct label for the following text?",D
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine this, you should consider the text and the",D
