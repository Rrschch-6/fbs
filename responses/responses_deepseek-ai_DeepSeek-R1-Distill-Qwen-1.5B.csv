Okay, let's see. I need to figure",D
well if you have got a so if you go to ten mils instead of five,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""label"": ""Be"", ""label"": """,Be
well then you re going to have a,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Wait, no, the example shows that in the",S
a switch on,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Okay, so let's break down the problem.",S
that is what one of the questions was the other switch goes past there we want to wa,S,"{""label"": """"}
</think>

{""label"": ""D""}",D
one you re inside the protective thing,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""label"": ""Be"", ""label"": """,Be
two it s not got power,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
this is really difficult is not it,Bs,"{""label"": """"}
Okay, I need to figure out how to assign the",D
yeah it will be like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F"", ""isinstance"": true, ""description"": """,F
but its very similar,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
it s just for the skilled personnel to use in their lab,Bs,"{""label"": """"}
To get started, I need to assign one label per",D
the print quality in a way,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, the following clues are provided:",D
what is the range of angles,Be,"{""label"": """"}
To solve this, I'll analyze the text for labels",D
it s just to measure what you what the parameters are,S,"{ ""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""D""}",D
if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": ""something""}

Wait, I'm getting a bit stuck. Let",D
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""...""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": """"}
To solve this, I need to break down the text",D
like a millimetre or so,S,"{label: __}

Text: ""the sledge manages to keep level""",D
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": """"}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""D""}",D
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""something""}

Wait, the text is: ""yes from what",D
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Wait, no, the examples show that when a",F
that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Wait, but according to the allowed labels, '",S
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""F"", ""F"": ..., ""Be"": ..., ""Bs",Bs
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Wait, but I need to refer to the guide",F
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""F"", ""isinstance"": ""F"", ""isinstance",F
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Wait, no, the user provided a list of",S
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{ ""label"": ""...""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": """"}
To determine the label, consider the following rules:

-",D
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to determine which label applies",D
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
</think>

{""label"": ""D""}",D
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""but we should also not forget that",F
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""I need to make sure that the",F
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""reason"": """", ""description"": """", ""examples",F
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""F"", ""is"": ..., ""be"": ..., ""bs",F
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""F"", ""d"": ""D"", ""s"": """,D
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": """"}
To determine the label, use the following rules:

1",D
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""___""}
Alright, so I need to figure out the correct",D
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""...""}
To solve this, I need to break down the text",D
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{ ""label"": ""S"" }

Text: ""but the sledge is",S
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""F"", ""is"": ""yes"", ""because"": """,F
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""reason"": ""...""}

Text: ""the she",F
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": """"}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""F"", ""isinstance"": true, ""label"": """,F
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

Alright, let's break down the text:",D
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""something""}

Wait, the user hasn't provided a specific text",D
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{ ""label"": ""_______"" }

Now, let's think about the",D
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""be"": 0, ""Bs"":",Bs
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""description"": """", ""examples"": """", ""label",F
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Okay, I need to figure out how to assign",F
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so it's better to have a",S
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""something""}

Wait, I need to figure out the correct label",D
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, I need to analyze the text",D
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""be"": 0, ""bs"":",F
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": """"}
To determine the label, consider the text. First,",D
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{ ""label"": ""...""} 

So the user is trying to label some text",D
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": """"}
To determine the label, I will analyze the text for",D
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Wait, but in the examples, sometimes it's",S
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""D"", ""Be"", ""Bs"", """,Bs
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }

The options are F, Be, Bs,",Bs
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""_______""}

To determine the label, I need to analyze",D
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""F"", ""d"": """"}

Text: ""to push",F
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{ ""label"": ""..."" }
</think>

The text describes a situation where the",D
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": """"}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""..."">
To determine the label, analyze the text using the labels",D
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""...""}
To determine the label, analyze the text and the allowed",D
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""F"", ""isinstance"": true, ""type"": """,F
