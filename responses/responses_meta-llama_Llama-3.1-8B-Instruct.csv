so providing we could provide a heat source,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the main purpose of the pen",Be
then we could reveal anything which is printed on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding thing to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # or Be, or S, or D",Bs
so technically the stuff where you have got a low percentage fill sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

but if we could do that with the media,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

whether we could do that with this adaptation I don t know,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

the one on the right the one on the right does not actually have to be a thermal pen it could just be,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""a normal pen just with a special",F
it could be a soldering iron,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it can be used to solder components",S
or a hot air,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so that it can be used",S
but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and the idea is that this is",Be
whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""but I think the most important thing",Bs
there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because of the specific media""
Label",F
so basically the first problem that we need to think about is the wobbly arm movement of the users,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""it does make it very difficult to",F
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and they will be able to write",Bs
so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so ther there is two important things",D
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so the way that the thermal paper",F
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""this is the 1st prototype",Be
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""we have to make sure that the",F
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""I think the tip is a bit",F
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # one of F, Be, Bs,",Be
is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

even thought the user might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on that,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we have a number of different types",Be
is it only paper you re thinking about or could it be other things like mugs or fabric or pottery,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

the sledge excellent,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the pen is quite nice""

write sledge,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the idea is to create a new",Bs
so what did that generate then,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""so that is a bit of",D
the sledge manages to keep level,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""the sledge has a steel",Bs
by having quite a wide base,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the goal of this is to have",Bs
write wide base,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""with a very smooth surface""

a main force in the middle,BS,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the paper is a very important part",Be

Text: ""and it s really not that big",Bs
the sledge is er quite broad,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""but it is the way that the",S
and then you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""the key is to make sure",Bs
write force in middle,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so it is for drawing""
Label",Bs
more often than say a sledge or a snowboard a skis or snowboard,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it s a really simple idea""",D
so so would you potential see some some some guiders almost down the side of this,S,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""so the idea is to get",D
well I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the pen is a pen""
Label",Bs
to have a set of stabilisers on it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the new design is to have",Bs
based on the idea of a sledge,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""because of the lack of the ball",Bs
yeah no problem stabilisers like a bicycle yeah that is a good idea,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""but I think the problem with the",Be
write stabiliser,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the ink is flowing too fast""",Bs
I was thinking that is sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  # correct
Text: ""that's the",S
yeah write Universal base ,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""this is the first prototype""

if the is like this it stays flat but the bit you hold onto can be at,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is the part of the pen",Bs
different angles,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the paper is involved in all of",S
I guess the size of the thing in contact with the paper you could either have a very small contact area,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""which is not the case here,",Be
and er track where it goes or you can have a wide contact area,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # You can write your answer in this format",Bs
show the relative size of the pen clears throat if you have got an example because that is,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the pen will have a certain number",Be
look at the end of that,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

size is dictated by cost really it needs to be quite narrow,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  # function
Text: ""because of the",F
I imagine it to be that,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the way it works is because of",F
could be a that way,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

lets just use that as guidance but let us,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

while drawing if I where yeah the resistors sit on the lump there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # Be/Bs choice based on part cause",Bs

draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 2,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""draw refE1_15",S
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so we can make a lot of",S
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and then we have the thermal paper",D
no its not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it should be easy to make""",D
it ll be about fifty percent more expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because of the ink""
Label (",Be
yes this there is an end,S,"{""label"": ""D""} 

Text: ""and we are looking at this",D
there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it can draw a line and then",Bs
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""we have to make sure that the",D
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the thermal paper can draw with a",S
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""but its also very good for the",Bs
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # or Be, or S, or F",Bs
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and then the next thing is",Be
yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the the the tip of the",Bs
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and the other one is the same",Bs
draw angle,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""draws smoothly""
Label (JSON",S
so we were talking mostly about that one or that one,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so we re going to use a",D
that one sort of plus or minus,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because of the ink viscosity""
Label",Be
all these you have to keep flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so we have to use a special",S
its just its just whether we need flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""but that is not really important at",Bs
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the thermal ink is a bit of",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so it is a question of whether",S
yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is designed to work with",Be
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the 3d printed pen is",D
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the tip is a metal tip and",Be
draw circle draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""this is a thermal pen and we",D
and then you had a tracker like an optical mast then,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  # Correct!

Text: ""and then you",S
draw box draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the first one is a pen which",D
I think that picture where you re moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and we have a number of",Be
instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just do a thin line at a time,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""I am going to do a test",Be
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so the idea is to have",S
but when you scribble backwards and forwards it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and the reason for that is",Be
would build up and use that tracking capability to do that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""is that the way you d like",F
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""draw refE1_15 Flip",D
and you would not have the angle problem,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because of the angle of the tip",Be
yeah the problem is that printing on the ball,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""because it s the way the ball",Bs
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""because of the way the ball is",Bs
so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because it is just a small part",Be
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and then the paper is a bit",D
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so you would have a very small",Be
we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""it s a good point""
Label",F
we did that,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the pen has a special tip that",D
with the dots though very very small,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""because of the tip of the pen",S
you can only they ve got such low they will last thermal mass,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it will be very fast to write",Be
you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and then you can use them in",Be
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the paper will be the main part",Be
probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and that s the thermal head""",Bs
but you can make it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so that it can be used to",Bs
clears throat erm at the moment what we have got available for a demonstrator is one of the types on the left,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""clears throat erm at the moment",S
so we do have this constraint of what that angle needs to be ,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""we will be using the same materials",F
so that is going to,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""it has a porous tip which causes",F
that angle here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the ink flows through the print head",S
yes that is going to limit us for the time being,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so for the pen to be successful",D
we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""this is the main purpose of",Be
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

slightly more expensive version that is got a spring either side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the new thermal pen uses a special",Bs
yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and you can see that the one",Bs
they do yeah there is its one with the foils basically because on this the foil is sprung this one is well no,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # correct

the foil will run through rubbers and it uses the the cutting edge that is sprung,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # or your answer

so you could switch it on and off,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and then the pen would start to",Be
yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well because,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it comes on how you want it to,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

you put in holes to see where your feet are going,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

its just so you could acquire lots of stuff where you re actually marking,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

it becomes more complex to the user as well you can rotate it so you can get to this corner or,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

yeah nice idea,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""this is a very good idea""",D
it is a bit like the suspension on a car,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

as well stay in contact with the road if you have got a decent car,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

if you do not if you do not let it gimble that way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

then you add a feature by taking out you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

you can you can if this pen if you do not let it go that way you could make it print dotted line print dotted line,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

oh so you just have you just have one print out one,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and then the thermal head is connected",Be
one one nozzle dot touching,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""a very simple structure""
Label (",Bs
so I guess what you re saying is any mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""that we can use to get the",Bs
you can have it switch on switch off one could be easy line and then you can switch it off so that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""there s also a metal tip which",F
you could,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""there is a lot of different things",D
write vary the angle to have different width of line,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the design of the pen has been",Bs
you could use it just so at the corner of the printer head,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it's been a problem in the",Bs
well you could do that just electronically by activating one of the channels on the print heads,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the printer will have a mechanism to",Bs
write or do this electronically,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so that the ink is in the",F
I think that is the way to do it because,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it will draw a line that is",Bs
otherwise you can overheat the print head and might damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and the second one is the thermal",Bs
so part of the thing here is we need to erm hold it down,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this is the actual prototype that we",Bs
otherwise it going to overheat as its firing if there is no where for the heat to go,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we will be using the thermal head",Bs
could we put erm can we detect the heat that the,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the the tip is really important because",Be
and therefore switch it off,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and we can see that this is",Bs
or know what s going on,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""but in terms of the the actual",D
er that is only going to stop it getting dangerously hot,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it needs to print legibly at",Be
all we need to do for print quality and performance and things,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""we need to do for print quality",F
is to keep those dots on the paper when they re being fired,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is because the dot on the",Bs
the other thing which you will picture sort of erm to an extent that one as well is the actual steering erm is actually,F,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and that is the real main",Be
at the moment the hand steers it directly by making movements with the hand,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",Be
but if you had like a joystick,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it would be a very different product",Bs
that then moved the angle of the print head errm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and the way it works is",Bs
that might work too but maybe a bit more expensive I suppose,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because the pen is made of a",Be
I think the interesting thing is to use is as they steer that its built into the steering,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # or F, Bs, S, D",Be
actually tilts the whole body as it steers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we need to create a new way",Bs
so in order to maintain that angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""with the new tip, you can",Be
write integrate the steering into angle like snowmobile,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the thermal printer is very slow",Bs
it compensates for the lean of the rider into the corner,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the bike's weight distribution is affected",Be
so it s flat,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""we need to use a special thermal",S
so if we had something like that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""with a large number of sensors and",Be
you could steer this angle of the pen as it moves to the other end,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the idea is to make the pen",Bs
its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""if you want to do something more",Be
or you take all the opportunities for control away from people apart from moving around,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""and you re left with this kind",D
and you make the pen or whatever it is do everything,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and that s the point of the",Be
erm or we give some feedback erm,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""erm so this is the"" →",D
so that people know when they re doing the right thing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the pen is not very good""",F
write feed back to user when doing it right,D,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""has to be able to write at",F
erm or the last one is it is possible to hold it the wrong way,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""erm but it has to be said",Bs
but it forces you to hold it the right way possibly base on shapes,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""you can just print a lot of",Bs
write make the shape so it can only be done one way,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the shape is good because it prevents",Bs
well for the the third you can make it erm hard make it compliant to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""so we need to make sure",F
I know I know what you re saying but it would be difficult,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so you want to make it a",Bs
because you would overheat the edge of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so that the ink flows smoothly""",Bs
if its not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and then the head will move""",Bs
but there could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads overheating it must be touching at the other end,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is the reason the pen is",Bs
so I shall switch this,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so I shall switch this""
Label",S
yeah probably there must be some way of detecting that,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and that is the key thing""",D
can I just explore that last one in a little more detail,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}  # (no label applicable)

Text: """,D
because when organisations,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""are looking to implement a solution""",Bs
making sure they can only be correct in one way so the design and shape of the thing,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""because of the design""
Label (",F
so it can only be done in one way and that s the correct way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it s just a standard"" →",Be
because then there is less sort of learning to be done by the user and children I think if they are you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then you re going to see",Bs
if they don t get the results pretty quickly they will just give up on it erm,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the design of the pen is a",D
so it would be quite good shape of,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the ink will be drawn onto the",S
it would only let it work in one particular way,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the paper is not the most important",Bs
you could build it in different ways so you could have it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it would be a good idea to",S
so that there was only one way of doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the paper is a bit more expensive",F
but then err you can have switches on it so that supposing supposing it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""and then the the the ink the",F
you have got the print head and three balls around it to support it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it needs to be able to take",S
with pressure sensors on those balls,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the purpose of the project is to",Bs
so if the child presses harder it activates all the bearings,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and that s what the bearing does",Bs
and prints out a very erm heavy line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and I am going to talk about",Bs
but if the child does not press hard then you activate every other one,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""I think the child has to be",Bs
so you get a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it's a bit more like a",Be
write interaction between how child presses so activation of print head,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the interaction between the thermal pen and",Bs
so clears throat the actual kind of the erm the print head is isolated from what the child s doing,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""for a specific purpose""
Label (",Bs
and so you can trick the child into doing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so we re going to go to",F
and you could also make it so that even if the child s because erm clears throat its not direct you can make it sort of software,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and you could also make it so",F
so that even if the child s really uncoordinated basically you get a reasonable result,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Text: ""and that s because of the",F
but if the child s very coordinated you can actually do some quite sophisticated things,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

if you lift it off the page you can,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

actually see its got the pattern it creates separates into two areas,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

turn the light on I don t know how to operate,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""The pen is designed to print leg",D

Text: ""the other ideas on the paper",Be
when you talked about the little light in front of the erm pen,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we will use the standard thermal paper",Bs

Text: ""and this is the part where I",Bs
you do more of that which I don t do,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

that is because you did not have that pen when you were little,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

if you had had it you would write in the right way rather that the wrong,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

you get inking pens,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

that are really hard to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # Your answer goes here

print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it s the paper that s the",Bs
and when you push on it erm it opens a valve which lets the erm which lets the ink through,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

no it s like you get them for erm drafting pens,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so I m looking for the one",S
I think work like that they have got they re like that,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""we need to add a new material",D
because they they come in different bits of tube,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this is a type of printer""",Bs
and they give you a very accurate width of line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""this is the reason why we re",Be
OK but you cannot you cannot use them in any orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so I think it s just a",S
you have to use in straight up and down,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it is designed for printing on regular",Bs
and so if you put it on the edge the you would go on the edge of the tube,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we should also not forget that the",Bs
and it just it would just sort of it just the edge just goes on,S,"{""label"": ""D""}  # → Label: D

you will never get it you just crease the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""you need to make sure that the",Bs
the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback s inherent is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is the goal of this project",Bs
if you re not doing it properly it wont work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the feed roller is not rotating""",Be
it will probably it will probably be that if you do it on the edge,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the thermal paper is the one that",Be
the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the PCB,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the thermal head will be close enough",Bs
and you ll lift the whole the whole thing off,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""this is the part of the product",D
so you probably wont be able to do this this sort of touch towards the edge,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""we need to make sure that",Bs
because the print head the resistors are in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the ink flows through the channels""",Bs

Text: ""this is the first prototype""

just the kind of thing that you could do,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

so it just feels right you not do you are limited to what you can do,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we want to do something that is",Be
if you put your fingers in the wrong place,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it needs to be able to write",Bs
and if we cut all that for I mean this version,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""we can have the pen be a",Be
it could be much chunkier,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the main difference is the material of",Be
and this thing could go in the hole this lot could go in the hole,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so it is a bit like a",Bs
and perhaps you can mirror it so it works for left handed people as well,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the best part about it is that",Be
but you could just make a hole to hold it in either way,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it's a simple design""
Label",Bs
you d have to certainly with the first go realize where to put their fingers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

it might not even work,Be,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""the pen is held in the",D
if one of their fingers is not in the right hole,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is not going to work""",Bs
also you feed it back to the wrist,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it will be a small pen""",D
there is all different things,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it was a great way to get",S
yeah hand sizes as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""because the material of the pen is",Bs
you know you could you feed it back,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""but also with a pen""

so its kind of like a watch or something on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""we need to use a special kind",Be
well you could have a battery pack in that could not you,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it also needs to be able to",Bs

if you have got if you have got a switch there there there and there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""that is the standard plain thermal paper",Bs
draw Document E1_4Sketcjjpg crosses indicate position of switchs,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the other pen with the new paper",Bs
and it only works if all four switches are down,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it only works if all four switches",Bs
and those switch positions guarantee that the head is down then,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and so the head is down""",Bs
yeah that is the control approach is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""but the actual thing that we have",Be
yeah that is the yeah and you design it in such a way that,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""and so that is the reason""",F
that is a reasonably comfortable position,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the pen has a pen holder""",Be
and if you don t put it in that position,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and then the pen will be a",Bs
it does not work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""so I will make sure that",Be
it d be nice though if you naturally pick it up and it works,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because of the new er er er",Be
yeah but that is you can do the two together can you,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so we ve got the the ink",D
the other thing to to think about is in almost all cases when I look at pens the apart from re wired sort of micropens,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""I would say is the the user",F
the th tip is actually the narrowest part of the product,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is the th tip that is",Bs
whereas in what we re looking at it could actually be as wide or wider,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""this is the one where the",Be
so its more like a paintbrush is not it like a DIY paintbrush,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this is a new product and its",Bs
it s more like a roller like a roller yeah,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""you can see the difference between the",Bs
its there is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it is a very simple design""",S
if you had like if you if you had it connected to one side like that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""because of the of the thermal",Bs
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""there are a few things that are",D
or a it would be here the print head you could have then going to there then going to there is,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""or the second part is a pen",Bs
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""we also need to make sure",S
that you don t smudge it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the special paper""
Label",Bs
it would have flexibility because of the metal on which it s hinged if you like,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # No output
Text: ""the paper",Bs
yeah I think actually I wonder if you intuitively know how to use a roller,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # one answer per line
Text: """,Be
because you re older than eleven and intuitive if you have never seen it before,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we have a problem with the ink",Bs
my two year old rolls paints,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the kids were painting and the paint",D
but I think it could be the pen I mean it could be we could shape it so it does make it like a finer tip,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and then we have the actual pen",Bs
yeah but there is an inherent size issue with holding it this way is not there,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the reason is the ink flows to",Bs
because you re not going to have you you you used to have these pens that were ginormous and,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and they were really heavy and then",Bs
it had lots of different pens inside it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it was used to draw lines""",S
yeah and they re all like this round,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and then you put it in a",S
and it made it really difficult to write with at the right angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so it was the combination of both",Bs
so I think there is an issue about how big or how,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""the pen that is being used",Bs
big,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the pen is designed to draw thin",D
you might not hold it,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the ballpoint pen can't write",S
yeah I think that is worth considering it actually,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so I am thinking about this idea",D
the not having it in a pen shape,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it needs to be small""
Label",S
the not holding it like a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the heat""
Label (",Bs
but actually holding it in a different way like that or,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and the thing is the thermal paper",Be
yeah there are two there are two sides to this I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the special ink""
Label",Bs
either you want to teach children to hold a pen properly,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the pen is very good at drawing",F
if you wanted to do that you d give them a,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the one on the left has a",F
yeah but you have got to be taught how to hold a pen,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""you have to be careful not to",F
a lot better as write like this as well,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""you can use a pen that has",Be
different people will write,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # Correct?
Text: ""the pen is",Be
with not smudging the ink,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it's a very precise line""",Bs
different people will hold the pen between these two fingers and write like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is used by different people",Be
they should not be allowed,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it's a bit of a challenge",S
is it a training aid or toy that we re is it for fun,F,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Text: ""to draw the the lines the",F
its for fun,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""it was made from a metal""",F
its mainly really for fun really I think erm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so its going to be a real",F
because if you want to teach a child something about pens,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and you want it to be a",F
you d give them a pen would not you,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and then you have to put the",F
no well it depends it could be funit could teach you something,F,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and that s a lot of the",D
an added bonus I suppose,F,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""we have to make sure that we",D
it could teach you something else,F,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Text: ""it is the part that is",F
its going to be quite a fat lump probably,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the user is not supposed to know",S
so it s not going to be that kind of pen that you use in future,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""it s going to be a",Be
so it does not feel much like a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so the idea is to make a",Be
you know it could I think it could be more of a decorator s thing you know,F,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so we could use that to",Be
if you want to put a row of smilies in,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because the pen has a large ink",F
paper and pen along the edges of you know,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it will draw a line of ink",S
on the wall,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""to print on this paper""
Label",S
you re never gonna draw a whole pic you re never gonna draw paint the Sistine chapel,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""and the idea is that you",D
no you d need more batteries,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because it is very very good at",Be
its more of sort of decorative kind of features,F,"{""label"": ""F""}  # Label: Function
Text: ""so",F
things like that you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # correct
Text: ""and then it",Be
there is another degree of freedom to this thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""and it s not just the pen",D
if you go fast it will be a paler colour,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""if you go fast it will be",Bs
if you go slowly it will be darker wont it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the pen draws on the paper in",Bs
yeah if you go fast well maybe if you go fast if there is no feedback from the paper it does not matter how fast its going,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then the pen is very light",Bs
then it might produce gaps but it might produce gaps in places of,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is a thermal printer with a",Bs
the thing would be cool,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""it will be more reliable""
Label",F
if you drive it faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the tip is made of ceramic""",Bs
that mark is the same as that,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""there is no real technical barrier to",D
that is what you will end up with but erm you won t end up with a long smooth line erm that is faint erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the pen has a lot of different",D
definitely gaps in it head on all the time you don t have the head on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this is the key feature that s",Bs
yeah you could turn it off off and on very fast could not we,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so we have to work with the",Be
for the usefulness er well I am just I am just trying to think about what erm what the pen does really erm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the tip is just a bit porous",F
if it s if it s a if its fun its got to do,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so what s the best way to",F
sort of a wider range of features,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it's the interaction between the special",Be
features somehow,F,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""this is not a technical specification""",D
I think it might self regulate,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so it does need to be a",Be
I think people might visit around how does it work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""I think it s a good idea",Be
or they use it more slowly I think that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because of the pressure the ink flows",Be
but I am thinking it will it will be more fun,F,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it is a nice pen to write",D
if you can get something you know if you can get a faint line or,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""it will be a bit more",Be
a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""draws a faint line""
Label",Be
you had a drawing there that you did was that for any particular purpose,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""I think we should use the same",F
I ve seen a pen that somebody s created,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""The pen is also a marker""",D
where its actually got this kind of loop in it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the pen is able to draw",Bs
so that if you hold it with your index finger actually through this,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""so that the ink is on",F
so it s you you almost wear it like a glove,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""this is the only way it can",Be
deep breath in yeah or like a sort of ring on your finger with the pen attached to it,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so we can use it as a",D
but it forces you to hold it in a very specific way,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # You can ask for help if you're",Bs
um that is intriguing sort of like a like a could be like a finger puppet could not it,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and I think we could also use",Be
yeah cos wearing it like a finger puppet,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so basically the design is to make",Bs
the feel of it might be fun,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""it is also very good at printing",F
exactly so you can make you can make the footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the idea is to make the foot",Be
I I think I think the sort of design not very good at,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the the way the paper works is",Be
Tom does that help regulate the angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""Because of the spring, the pen",Be
that would also tie in quite well the sort of cyber view,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so the pen is a real key",D
of having a pack on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because of the design of the watch",F
or sort of cyber arm is not it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""that s the real the real pen",S
thermal print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  # You can ignore this and focus on the",S
lightning coming out of his nose,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""the paper is the key""",F
is the issue of left and right handedness erm how we re going to resolve that,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""what about the media and the pen",Be
can you turn the print head round or,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""if you look at the diagram it",Be
it does not matter because as long as you have got as long as you have got features that can be either mirrored features the same on each side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""this is the main objective""",Bs
you have got them all like that,S,"{""label"": ""D""}  # or any of the other labels
Text",D
you have got some area to work with and then,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""you can draw with the pen""",S
you have to keep the area of the mirror image,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""I think the important thing is to",Bs
quite good,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so it is the interaction between the",D
in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it is not even a pen,F,"{""label"": ""D""}  # Done
Text: ""so the pen",D
because a pen you you will always learn to write from left to right whether you re left handed or right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""I am not sure what I am",Bs
so actually what you end up doing is left handed people is you smudge over over your work which is a problem,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so you can also make use of",F
but actually with this you re dragging it you re not pushing it are you most people will drag it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so you re not pushing it you",Bs
mostly dragging it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the design is based on the existing",Be
mmm because you were wired to drag it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that the pattern is visible""",Bs
will be dragged,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the pen is drawn""
Label (",Be
that is an interesting point,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""we need to make sure it is",D
mmm so you want a design then to sort of force people to drag,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Text: ""and then they get a certain",F
it which is not something you do with a marker pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""and then you re going to",S
you draw a line when you drag,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is the way to use the",Bs
generally you might do with a marker pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so that it can print the whole",S
with a marker pen you tend to drag yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the reason why the marker pen works",Bs
but what I am saying is the analogy of teaching people to write is not actually valid in the sense that,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the most interesting part is the way",Be
when you re writing you re not actually dragging usually apart from if you re right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""the tip of the pen is",Be
if you re right handed you drag,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""you need to drag your hand""",Be
if you re left handed you push,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then you have the right hand",Bs
so do they do a left handed version of this,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and then we have a new",Be
that s more interesting cos commercially lost that would be a loss leader just about,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}  # Correct!
Text: ""so it s",F
well it must it must cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""the pen will draw a circle",F
its gonna cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the problem is that its not smooth",D
but schools or something schools must buy two sets,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the ink reservoir""
Label",Bs
yeah its not worth its not really for schools,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""its not really for schools""
Label",F
well they had that in my school when I was in primary school everybody had a red fountain pen and I had a special green fountain pen because I was left handed,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  # Structure
Text: ""so the design",S
erm protecting the print head which I haven t really thought very much about,F,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s the interaction between the pen",Bs
but as it it might be a nuisance or bad thing,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the thing that it is doing",Bs
to have the print head projecting down out of the bottom of this most of the time,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""with the thermal ink flowing through the",Be
because it may catch on things like the edge of the table or something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the pen is quite reliable""
Label",Bs
and so erm perhaps there is something else a rounded lump or something,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and so erm perhaps there is something",S
as it approaches the page causes the print head to come down,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it will be used to draw a",Bs
which may carriage be sprung also,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""so the idea is to get",Bs
like a see saw,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it's a matter of how we",Bs
comes down,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""due to the fact that the tip",Be
like a nodding birds yeah,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the 2nd part of the",Be
if you have your printing head ,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the thermal head is made of """,S
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""It needs to print legibly at",S
and you have got you have got your spring like that ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then you have got your spring",Bs
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""we need to draw a small",S
and you have got a switch or something here ,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so it is a bit of a",S
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""draw E1_4 Sketchjpg",D
and you have got a case there ,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and that is a real plus point",S
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""draw E1_4 Sketch""",D
and then when you you can only push this,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so that you can have a good",Bs
and then when you push this up so that all the faces are touching,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""but the thermal paper is a key",Bs
that is when the switch goes,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it will only print 4 lines",Bs
erm so you get so so what this is is is maybe this is not erm err susceptible to knocks and things because its on a sp spring,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""erm so this is the erm",Bs
yeah and you get protected by a case,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the thermal paper is actually a key",S
but the other thing is the opposite of this being here,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # Be

that business of withdrawing the print head when it s not in use or something like that,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

well yeah well it s a sheath is not it that is the word you said was not it a sheath that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

a sheaf,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the pen is a pen""

Text: ""to make the whole thing more robust",Bs
OK it is fundamental the other thing that I am now going to look at is ,F,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""so we re going to use",F
two two problems one is over pressurising the print head on the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the other is the media itself and",Bs
or abuse of the pen so somebody could go like that,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

you could have you could balance springs and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # or one of the other labels

the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""the thermal pen cos I think",D
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""erm so we need to think about",D
in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the spring loading is quite important for",Be
well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and that is a good thing because",Bs
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and it s got the little bit",Be
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it can also be used in a",Be
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and that s what the whole thing",Bs
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is an example of a very",Bs
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and the the other one is a",Bs
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""we need to get the piston to",S
and then they could stay,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so that the pen works""
Label",D
do they really need to stay in contact well,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""they have to be in contact for",Be
if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it will just move slightly to the",Bs
edge and if you go over it if you come too high an angle,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because of the way the pen works",Be
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and the reason why this is so",Bs
or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and then you could have the cylinder",S
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""this is because the paper is quite",F
but what you cant do is it can t the print head can t tilt back or forward because these slots are in,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the thermal head is designed to",Bs
they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it s just a basic"" →",S
this this stays at a fixed angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # Enter your answer here

it can move up and down,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

the print head relative to the pen,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is made of plastic""
Label",Bs
I am sorry I am just thinking about I think there is probably a geometry that could do it with just one switch erm,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # or the correct label, if different",Bs
that when you come too far over erm the pen starts moving back in and so back in,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

we tend to do fairly wide print heads,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

it appears a bit different less controlled,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the pen tip is a bit too",Be

Text: ""so that the pen can be used",S
which brought the print head down brought the print head down,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

no,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it works""
Label (JSON only",D
what you always want to combine is something that when you press you press media,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

and there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it is a pen that uses thermal",S
we only need two in the front and back,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the paper is also very important for",S
so that as well as being in the right vertical position ie actually touching paper,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

could you have that front and back as well like a sort of cross,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

because they re on a spring and then you have got your central four points,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""that s the main purpose of",Bs
here this is going to be up then if you go in that planeover an angle too much ,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""this is not the final version of",D
my arg what I was trying to say before is erm,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""that the paper is so smooth that",Be
you could do it with one switch,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

if if the casework say the casework is comes out f further out errm ,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""if if the casework say",Be
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""but the real key is the thermal",D
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it was to use the switch to",Bs
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we will be using a new media",Bs
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the the design is to make",Bs
so that so that when it it does not actually erm,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so when it does not actually erm",F
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the first one is for the thermal",Bs
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the pen should be able to",S
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}  # You can delete this line if you don",D
draws,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""draws""
Label (JSON only",D
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the thermal paper is really good with",Be
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the temperature of the pen is not",Bs
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the first thing that we need to",Be
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and then the user can adjust it",Bs
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so that you can draw the same",F
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""if you look at the mechanism",F
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and so you want the thermal head",Bs
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that we can get a good",Bs
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""the one that has the pen",Bs
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""or if you wanted to have a",Be
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the tip of the pen is very",D
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and then we need to get",Bs
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so I think this is a great",Bs
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""we have to be careful with the",F
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""you will get a different effect""",Be
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and also that it has a tip",Bs
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we have to be careful with the",Bs
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the other one is the thermal paper",Be
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""it has a new style of pen",D
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the only thing that s going to",Bs
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the pen works in left handed mode",D
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""this is a bit of a tricky",Be
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and you can see that the pen",Bs
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and we also want to have",Be
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so that it doesn't get damaged",D
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""what about the second one""
Label",Bs
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the product will be made of a",Bs
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""that the pen is not the only",Be
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""I think this is a great idea",D
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # Correct label: Bs
Text: """,Bs
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and you could also push by pushing",Bs
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""but its also about the media""",D
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so the thing that is most important",D
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so that we can then make a",Be
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""D""}  # Don't forget to write JSON
Text",D
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""D""} 

Text: ""the thermal head is not the",D
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so it s the interaction between the",Bs
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it needs to switch on""
Label",Bs
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""I suppose that is the reason that",Be
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the pen will do this""
Label",D
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the first thing is the ink",Bs
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""is made of a thin metal wire",Bs
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the user just has to draw with",Bs
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""the goal is to make it",Be
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the other ideas on the paper there",Be
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}  # Done
Text: ""it s actually",D
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""so this is what we need",Bs
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}  # Don't forget to include the label in",D
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the way the pen moves""",S
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""I think the most important thing is",Bs
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the problem is that the ink is",D
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the new pen writes so smoothly",S
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and then we are going to do",Bs
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""to draw a pattern""
Label (",Be
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s not really relevant to the",Bs
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the main function of the pen is",Be
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and that s the whole point of",Bs
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s like a small window in",S
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so that it doesn't stick""",S
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the paper has to be drawn on",Bs
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""D""}  # Your answer here
```python
import",D
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so there is two ideas""
Label",D
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",Bs
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the thermal paper is a bit too",Bs
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it's a really good pen""",Be
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and the thermal pen is not good",S
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the first one is""
Label (",Be
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it has a special pen that is",Be
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it needs to be the same as",Bs
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""is that right""
Label (JSON",Bs
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""there s a lot of technical details",Bs
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and the edges here are at a",Bs
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we re going to use the one",Bs
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and then the ink flows out of",S
but if its too far out it wont be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and it has a small clip on",Bs
because its erm not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so its the interaction between the special",Bs
these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the heat""
Label (",Bs
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""we need to have a way to",D
because they don t touch this outer angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s not like the line is",Bs
yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""we could use the existing components to",D
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the mechanism is going to be made",Bs
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so you can just get away with",Be
but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""okay so we can make it even",Be
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is very good for drawing lines",Bs
you could just stick it on a on a rubbery pack or a film,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so I think it s a bit",S
sketching spring,D,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""this is a drawing of a spring",F
I er,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""what is the one that is the",D
they start doing this sheath that hits first,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and also the material of the thermal",Bs
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the one that is the most",Bs
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # This is the correct answer
Text:",Bs
so you can t do it quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # End of example

Text: ""it",Be
so you can t shock that thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is a special type of paper",Bs
that ll slo slow down and then it will slowly move back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and you can see how that s",Be
yeah but then when you erm take it off the paper it quickly pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the whole idea is that you",Bs
because this is a one way valve,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it is the reason why the pen",Bs
just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""because the rubber is very good at",S
they will be air in there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the idea is that the pen",Bs
so that spring quickly returns it back down to it s protective position,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because of the heat the ink flows",F
so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so it is a sort of a",Be
but as soon as you take it off it pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # (no label set provided, please fill",Bs
so its just good point actually clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we re going to be working with",Be
I was just thinking that relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""It has a good design and works",Bs
so if we moves it round masks speech contact with the surface,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the new pen has a special design",Bs
its going to have quite a bit of momentum still so erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we have a thermal pen and it",Be
quite hard or something that its pressed onto,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so that the ink doesn't dry",Bs
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""so we have the thermal pen",F
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""so it s the interaction between",Bs
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}  # Structure

Text: ""and it s",S
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the spring gives it a certain amount",Be
and then sort of smash onto something,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and then the thing you're holding",D
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and it s supposed to go in",S
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s got a a a a",Bs
protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we are looking at the ink flow",Bs
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the paper is not the best thing",Bs
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the reason I was looking at the",D
yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the real thing is that we need",Bs
no well as I say you need to shock that down ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is a thermal pen for drawing",Bs
you re smash you re gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath before this does anything in here,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s a very simple and straightforward",Bs
yeah also they re not that made out of ceramic and glass,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""and then you get the same",S
mmm I think that is I think that the other other protective thing,F,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this is what we re looking for",Bs
is whether they smash it off the table before momentum,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the way it works is that the",Bs
It s not it s not really kids sort of erm err throwing,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""I think it s about how",Be
it down its also people dropping it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the one on the left is the",Be
yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it's just a simple mechanical device",Bs
yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # answer

Text: ""and you have",Bs
then you can smash the edge of this,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and then you can just put",Bs
cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it so,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then the ink is actually getting",Bs
or whatever that we could perhaps achieve holding this thing flat to the surface,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so that we can draw a line",Be
the foam pads is an idea actually you could imagine,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it's the interaction between the special",D
a foam pad with an aluminium carrier on the front of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

a great density foam,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

that could give you the force of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

it could just recoil far enough it s a good idea actually,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # You can ignore this line and just fill",Bs
that could work,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

and it will just erm you have got spring and you have got some lovely,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so it is a bit like a",Be
could you even take that one further,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""I think we need to look at",D
like you could build the foam around the print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""to make it waterproof""
Label (",S
so you d have to press the foam back to actually reveal the print head in the first place,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s a good idea to press",Bs
so it almost wraps round a little bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""and it is a bit of",S
so if you go like that bang the foam needs to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and then you can take the plastic",F
perhaps not wrapped around to the extend in front of the housing,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that the lines are more steady",Bs
so that you know you need to press the foam,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because of the way the pen is",F
bit in before you actually start touching it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

yeah you need the foam,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

to do some damping,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # Correct answer: Be

so that is got to go somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

yeah you need the foam to have tha that sort of this sort of,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

we could we could have some sort of air bladder,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

yeah the gel,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

yeah techno gel,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

the only p gel,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

we ve talked a little about air cushions,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

any other ways that we could use sort of air pockets of some sort to,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the ink flows through the pen",Bs
you could make a magnetic force it in the middle,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and the only other thing I can",Bs
pellets,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""I am trying to understand what is",D
so it stays sort of stays,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the one that the one on the",D
pushed into it yeah you could do something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

magnets not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

air pockets are much cheaper,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

well that does not have to be that could be a balloon inside,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""it will just make it easier",Bs
yeah you could put a it on a pneumatic bladder in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""so it s really a lot",Bs
yeah or like a sort of bridge,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so we can use it to draw",Be
or you could do what they do in an old fashioned mouse not optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

with the b ball,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

just use gravity because it s own weight makes it roll on the mouse mat,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

five hundred grams is that wh is that the,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

oh you need five hundred grams OK that is fi,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

you need five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so that we can use it",S
how far s five hundred grams,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""so the ink flows down to",S
er er yeah if you take it to twenty mill,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""you can draw with it""

sort of half the compression that will be,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

I did not realise what this was this is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

it s a prototype model,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

why do you need that force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

err expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the one on the left is the",D
for contact is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""} 

Text: ""for the first time we are",D
well if you well if you well if you have got heat here,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it is a very important aspect of",D
and here its zero contact is not it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and here it's zero contact is",Bs
yeah so you need quite a strong contact basically,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""I m not sure about the idea",Bs
well if you have got a so if you go to ten mils instead of five,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""you will get a slightly better line",Be
well then you re going to have a,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so we need to think about the",Be
a switch on,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the switch causes the ink to flow",Bs
that is what one of the questions was the other switch goes past there we want to wa,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the way the tip is made is",Bs
one you re inside the protective thing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the protective thing is made of a",S
two it s not got power,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the the paper s got a certain",D
this is really difficult is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so the other thing is the paper",D
yeah it will be like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""and we can also draw with a",D
but its very similar,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""the ink is just in the",D
it s just for the skilled personnel to use in their lab,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the feed roller is made of plastic",F
the print quality in a way,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""we can also use the special paper",D
what is the range of angles,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the paper is the main contributor""",D
it s just to measure what you what the parameters are,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so we can see that the the",F
if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""we re going to use this thermal",F
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""we re going to have it so",Be
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is a good thing that we",Bs
like a millimetre or so,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it doesn't need to be too",S
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # Correct label: Bs
Text: """,Bs
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the other thing is that the",Bs
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this bit is the bit that s",Bs
that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and we have the option to use",Bs
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the key feature of this thermal printer",Be
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""this one uses a special type of",Be
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # Expected Behaviour (performance independent of specific parts",Be
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s the interaction between the special",Bs
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it needs to be able to withstand",Bs
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # correct
Text: ""and so the",Be
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this is the kind of thing that",Bs
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""but then there is the question",S
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is a good idea to use",Bs
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""due to the shape of the pen",F
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""because it's a lot of",S
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and the other thing is that it",Be
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the one that I m showing you",Bs
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""because the spring in the pen",S
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""} 

Text: ""the pen is going to be",D
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so it will be a nice piece",D
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the paper will be printed""
Label",F
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the pressure is due to the spring",Bs
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the sheath has a sprung she",Bs
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the design of the thermal pen is",Bs
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""this is a very important part of",S
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""erm and then you can also see",S
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the way it is designed is to",Bs
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""this sheath causes the pen to",Bs
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the user does not need to worry",Bs
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""we re going to use a pen",Be
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the new pen has a sheath",S
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the ink flows""
Label (JSON",D
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""with the new ink cartridge""
Label",Be
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}  # answer is D
Text: ""this",D
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so that it is not too heavy",S
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""I m not sure what I m",D
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""that is the one that is the",Be
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}  # (no label, delete this line and",D
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the first thing is to get",S
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the extra weight the lines",Bs
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the thing that really matters here",S
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""and then you will have to",S
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""because the pen is made of a",Bs
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the pen is a bit thicker",Bs
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""but we are not using the normal",S
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""I mean that s the basic",Be
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""this is the media that is used",Be
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the the design of the pen is",Bs
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so it is not just about the",F
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""that's why we need to use",Be
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the paper is not very good for",Bs
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it was a bad idea to make",Bs
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the tip of the pen is made",Bs
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""or if you want to be able",Bs
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""to draw a line""
Label (",Bs
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the design of the pen tip""",Bs
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so that you can draw lines that",Bs
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the pen is held in place with",Bs
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the problem is that it is not",Bs
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""to use the thermal pen with the",S
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and then you have this pen that",F
