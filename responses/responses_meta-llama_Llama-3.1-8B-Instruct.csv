Text: ""this is a new thermal pen""",S
there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""there is a bit that goes",S
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""but it s a different mechanism that",Be
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""draw refE1_15 Flip",S
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and you have got the type where",Bs
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""but with this pen you have a",Be
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because the flip chart is just a",Be
yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""erm so the the the the thermal",S
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and it s got a bit",Be
draw angle,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""what is the purpose of the pen",S
so we were talking mostly about that one or that one,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the problem is that the other pen",Be
that one sort of plus or minus,S,"{""label"": ""D""}  
Text: ""that one is a sort of",D
all these you have to keep flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the wobbly arm movement of",S
its just its just whether we need flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""because the sledge is very very",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the tip of the pen""
Label",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it s a bit like a s",S
yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the main idea is to have",Be
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the problem is with the way the",D
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the the the idea is that",Be
draw circle draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the key is to have a flat",S
and then you had a tracker like an optical mast then,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the optical mast is a bit tricky",S
draw box draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the thing that the thermal pen is",D
I think that picture where you re moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it s a simple way to create",Be
instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just do a thin line at a time,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the one on the right is the",Be
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the design of the pen is such",D
but when you scribble backwards and forwards it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""I think it s the angle",Be
would build up and use that tracking capability to do that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so we have to take the",Be
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""draw refE1_15 Flip",D
and you would not have the angle problem,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and you would not have the angle",Be
yeah the problem is that printing on the ball,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it's a very common problem""",Bs
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""we thought the ball could just be",Be
so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""if we have a a a a",Be
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""because the pen is quite heavy""",S
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so it is just a question of",S
we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""the thermal pen is a great",S
we did that,S,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""we did that because of the paper",D
with the dots though very very small,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the dots are on the surface of",S
you can only they ve got such low they will last thermal mass,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and that s the way that they",Bs
you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""you can make them change colour""",Be
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and we can use it for a",Be
probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the second one has got a",Bs
but you can make it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""it s a good idea""",S
clears throat erm at the moment what we have got available for a demonstrator is one of the types on the left,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s a erm it s a",S
so we do have this constraint of what that angle needs to be ,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so the main thing is that",Be
so that is going to,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so that is going to be a",F
that angle here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so that is the angle""
Label",S
yes that is going to limit us for the time being,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the sledge is er quite broad",Be
we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the design is focused on the user",Be
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it's got a universal joint which",S
to keep the to hold on to rather than actual hands are stabilised like a platform,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the design of the stabiliser",S
Sarah refers to a photograph,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""The photograph is printed on a glossy",Bs
a man s shaver,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the pen will draw a line""",S
that has an angle joint,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it is a very good idea""",S
and a guidance for your fingers,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so that it is easier to hold",S
and similar to the windsurf,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it has a universal joint""
Label",S
I mean it only moves in one axis,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the one on the top left is",Be
rather than round,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s a erm its not an",S
it does not its almost flat is not it I suppose,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the problem with the current one is",S
yeah it does not move that way I do not think,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it s a very cheap and simple",Be
cos you want to keep flat on the paper all the time,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""but you can t do that with",Be
does the razor stay flat though,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the reason it stays flat is the",Be
because the centre piece is much,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that we can get a good",Bs
I am not sure whether it does completely stay flat I think there might be a little bit of a plain,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and the bit you hold onto can",Be
but its main axis is is that the razor has is that way I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and the pen is quite light so",S
write razor,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""it's going to be a bit",D
if I if I remember correctly from I don t know about this but from the other razors each blade has like a little spring down each side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s a bit of a compromise",Bs
which means each blade can independently of housing can move that way a little bit as well cant it so that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it needs to be able to do",Be
draw E1_7 Sketckjpg,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""draw refE1_14 Flip",D
how s that achieved that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""what s the purpose of the thermal",Be
is that is that achieved by a plastic,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""I think it s a combination of",S
that is bendable or is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""this is a thermal pen""
Label",Be
no it s a spring is not it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so basically the first problem that we",S
a spring that goes to surface,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""a spring that goes to surface and",S
it pivots,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""it s a good idea to",Be
write spring pivot,D,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""the spring pivot is the most important",D
there is f five of the razors is not there,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so if we can get the paper",D
I have brought some examples along there is one with a single spring in the centre there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and one with two springs in the",S
and then there is one,S,"{""label"": ""D""} 

Text: ""and then there is one and",D
these are electric ones yeah,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""they re the most common ones""",S
these are electric razors and so this is,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""the thermal paper and the special",Be
slightly more expensive version that is got a spring either side,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the idea is to have a spring",S
yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""you can make the printout stay",Bs
they do yeah there is its one with the foils basically because on this the foil is sprung this one is well no,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""there is also a type of",Bs
the foil will run through rubbers and it uses the the cutting edge that is sprung,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the cutting edge that is sprung will",Bs
erm there is a point here,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""because of the friction""
Label (",F
as well that erm do we need to keep because this will keep an even well a relatively constant pressure won t it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""well that s the idea to keep",Be
and you could also you could add a switch to this,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and you could also you could add",S
so you could switch it on and off,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it s the same as the one",Be
yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well because,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and also the thermal paper is",Be
it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it comes on how you want it to,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it could be a design that is",Be
so is that what you call a gimble,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""this is the one that is",Be
gimbles are normally three dimensional,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so that the pen doesn't skip",S
I ve got another one,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""this one s the one I ve",D
it builds on another one,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it s a 3D printer",D
and it goes faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""so it's because of the",Be
but as well its erm one of the things about this is that you have got the main lump,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and the resistor on the lump sits",S
and then you have got steering piece towards the front which is banging near microphone drowns speech,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we need to find out what this",Bs
so you have got,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the main thing is that the",S
I guess you have kind of got the main unit that has got all the power and weight in it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and then you have got the pen",S

where I know we re talking about a pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

and you immediately think about something that is this sort of shape that you can hold in your hand like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and it s the same with the",S
but considering we re talking about toys in effect for children,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and it s not a very good",F
could it be something that takes more of the shape of a of a train with,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so I think we need to think",S
something else that gets pulled behind it for example,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""we have to make sure that it",S
like a drag on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it s the angle of the pen",Be
something that is much more of a quite a different shape that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it s a very small pen that",Be
does not require them to have that difficult sort of hold,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

things in place like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

because that is one of the challenges children have is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

holding the pen at the right angle,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""this is a very important aspect of",Be
that is probably one of the things you want to teach a child though is not,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}

a pens quite a nice sort of you know to get round angles and,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

can I just clarify that you mean for the main lump to have all the sort of the weighty bits like the batteries and electronics and things like that or the that way,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""to help children draw in a",D
I think that is the way to do it because,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the first thing that comes to mind",Be
otherwise you can overheat the print head and might damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the pen will print lines with a",Bs
so part of the thing here is we need to erm hold it down,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so we can use this as a",S
otherwise it going to overheat as its firing if there is no where for the heat to go,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the one that has got the s",Bs
could we put erm can we detect the heat that the,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""pen is producing and use that to",Be
and therefore switch it off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because the battery is not charged""",Be
or know what s going on,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so it s a really good idea",D
er that is only going to stop it getting dangerously hot,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""that is the sort of thing that",Be
all we need to do for print quality and performance and things,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""we should make it smooth""
Label",F
is to keep those dots on the paper when they re being fired,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the dot is being fired""
Label",Be
the other thing which you will picture sort of erm to an extent that one as well is the actual steering erm is actually,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the way that the user is going",Be
at the moment the hand steers it directly by making movements with the hand,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the user has to hold the",Be
but if you had like a joystick,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the one on the top left is",S
that then moved the angle of the print head errm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""if it s a corner one then",Be
that might work too but maybe a bit more expensive I suppose,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""the one on the right is",Bs
I think the interesting thing is to use is as they steer that its built into the steering,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""and the wheel is made of",Bs
actually tilts the whole body as it steers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""it s a good thing I",Bs
so in order to maintain that angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it needs to be a certain length",Be
write integrate the steering into angle like snowmobile,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it's like a hot air pen",Bs
it compensates for the lean of the rider into the corner,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the steering wheel is mounted on a",Bs
so it s flat,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s got a good grip""",S
so if we had something like that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and the pen moves in a way",S
you could steer this angle of the pen as it moves to the other end,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and this is the bit that you",Be
its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Text: ""and we can also go to",F
or you take all the opportunities for control away from people apart from moving around,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""if it is a single user it",Be
and you make the pen or whatever it is do everything,Be,"{""label"": ""D""} 
Text: ""and you make the pen do",D
erm or we give some feedback erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""erm I think that is the most",Be
so that people know when they re doing the right thing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the user has to hold the pen",F
write feed back to user when doing it right,D,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""when the user presses the button""",Be
erm or the last one is it is possible to hold it the wrong way,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and you can still get a good",Be
but it forces you to hold it the right way possibly base on shapes,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""you can have a very small contact",Be
write make the shape so it can only be done one way,D,"{""label"": ""S""}  # Structure (materials, parts, configuration),",S
well for the the third you can make it erm hard make it compliant to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because it s a thermal pen and",F
I know I know what you re saying but it would be difficult,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""this is going to be a",Be
because you would overheat the edge of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so the printer needs to be able",Bs
if its not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we need to make sure that the",Bs
but there could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads overheating it must be touching at the other end,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the main goal is to create a",Bs
so I shall switch this,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so it s just a bit of",Bs
yeah probably there must be some way of detecting that,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and that is the main problem we",Be
can I just explore that last one in a little more detail,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so basically the first problem that we",D
because when organisations,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the main goal is to create a",Bs
making sure they can only be correct in one way so the design and shape of the thing,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""this is the most important thing to",Be
so it can only be done in one way and that s the correct way,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and it has got a screw in",Be
because then there is less sort of learning to be done by the user and children I think if they are you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""but you can also use the existing",Bs
if they don t get the results pretty quickly they will just give up on it erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the most important thing is that it",Be
so it would be quite good shape of,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""to be honest I think this is",S
it would only let it work in one particular way,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""because of the way it is",Bs
you could build it in different ways so you could have it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so you could have it in a",S
so that there was only one way of doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""it can draw in any direction""",F
but then err you can have switches on it so that supposing supposing it,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so that the user can turn it",Be
you have got the print head and three balls around it to support it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""the balls are made of a",S
with pressure sensors on those balls,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""but it could be a good idea",Bs
so if the child presses harder it activates all the bearings,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the bearings are a problem""
Label",Bs
and prints out a very erm heavy line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""but the idea is to have a",Bs
but if the child does not press hard then you activate every other one,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""but if the child does not press",Be
so you get a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it s a very simple one""",Be
write interaction between how child presses so activation of print head,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the idea is to design a pen",Bs
so clears throat the actual kind of the erm the print head is isolated from what the child s doing,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the other thing is the print",S
but the sensors,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""are not affected by the temperature""",S
attend to what the child s doing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""if the child does it this",Be
and the thing responds accordingly,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""and the thermal pen works perfectly",Be
and so you can trick the child into doing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the thing is you have to have",F
and you could also make it so that even if the child s because erm clears throat its not direct you can make it sort of software,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""and the way it works is that",F
so that even if the child s really uncoordinated basically you get a reasonable result,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because of the special tip and the",Be
but if the child s very coordinated you can actually do some quite sophisticated things,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it s a bit like a piece",Be
you could even have sort of some feedback,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""if the is like this it stays",Be
in terms of colour LEDs on the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the one on the right does",S
saying that he s done a good or she s done a good job or,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because the pressure is on""
Label",F
that is a bit that is a bit peachy I think somehow,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and then you have the weight right",D
yeah you know because i if they re doing something and it produces a result,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""but what about the thing that s",Be
that is what they want is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so what we re going to do",F
that is what they want and saying well done is not really you know so what,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""and I think that is the most",F
spirit level in the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the pen can draw a line",S
3D spirit level the dot and the ring you the dot,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the dot and the ring you the",F
write spirit level in the pen,D,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""the pen is held by the user",D
if it goes off centre you know the dots outside the ring,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because the paper is being used in",Be
the pen would not work,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

so you have got to come in,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

you could have games built into it could not you,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so the pen is designed to write",Be
you could have something like colouring in,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

once more let us explore this spirit level in more detail I corrected the transcript,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

that is come out in the sort of DIY world is these laser levellers and things like that if,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

that made sure that it was level of some sort erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

you know the child can actually see a line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

you could project something onto the paper in front of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

turn the light on I don t know how to operate,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

yeah well if you left it a few minutes,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the design is the pen is the",Bs
when you talked about the little light in front of the erm pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so it s a thermal pen that",S
but if there is sort of feedback from the print head to know its in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

you do have to hold in a certain orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

that is what I join my fingers up at the top where as that one expects that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and that is what is causing",Be
you do more of that which I don t do,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the other one is a big deal",F
that is because you did not have that pen when you were little,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

that are really hard to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # Correct

Text: ""the pen is",Be
because they look they look like little erm they they they go straight down like that sketching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

helps you,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the pen is very reliable""",S
to use straight up and down otherwise they don t otherwise they don t work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and we have got a couple of",Be
because they work thr they th they re like a little er tube,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and they re made of plastic""",Bs
and when you push on it erm it opens a valve which lets the erm which lets the ink through,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s a good idea to use",Bs
is that those gold and silver type things,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""can you imagine a world where you",S
that people use for making cards,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the goal is to have a",S
no it s like you get them for erm drafting pens,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and you get them for erm drafting",S
I think work like that they have got they re like that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and the and the thing is that",S
because they they come in different bits of tube,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""it is a very long piece",S
and they give you a very accurate width of line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because the pen is designed to be",Be
OK but you cannot you cannot use them in any orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""The user cannot hold the pen in",S
you have to use in straight up and down,BS,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the thing is that the thing",S
and so if you put it on the edge the you would go on the edge of the tube,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and the the the the the the",Bs

Text: ""and it just it would just",S
you will never get it you just crease the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so you need to have a system",Bs
the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback s inherent is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""this is a good idea because the",F
if you re not doing it properly it wont work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it has a big impact on the",Be
it will probably it will probably be that if you do it on the edge,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s a big thing to make",Bs
the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the PCB,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""because it is very cheap""

and you ll lift the whole the whole thing off,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so we can see that the the",S
so you probably wont be able to do this this sort of touch towards the edge,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

because the print head the resistors are in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

PCB yeah,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""it s a thermal pen and it",D
just the kind of thing that you could do,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the new thermal pen is designed to",F

Text: ""the pen is made of plastic""",Be
if you put your fingers in the wrong place,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the pen is quite light""

it could be much chunkier,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and then you have the type where",Be

Text: ""and then the user would have to",S
you d have to certainly with the first go realize where to put their fingers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

it might not even work,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the other ideas on the paper there",Be
if one of their fingers is not in the right hole,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so it s not that the pen",Bs

you know you could you feed it back,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

for the usefulness er well I am just I am just trying to think about what erm what the pen does really erm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

if it s if it s a if its fun its got to do,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it is not even a pen,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

I guess beyond the actual pen you could imagine all sorts of systems where,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the mechanism might look like,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so you can see the mechanism of",Be
the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so it s the interaction between the",F
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the spring loading is not that",Be
well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s a little bit more complicated",S
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""you want to use the pen it",Be
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so we could do that with the",Be
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the metal piece is actually a bit",Be
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that it doesn t get lost",Bs
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""or you could have that as",Be
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""the contacts are on the top",S
and then they could stay,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and then they could stay at the",S
do they really need to stay in contact well,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

edge and if you go over it if you come too high an angle,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it would fall off and you need",Bs
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the thing is you can have a",S
or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so it would be a bit more",S
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the user should be able to move",F

they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the user has to move it to",Be
this this stays at a fixed angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is held at a",Be
it can move up and down,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

the print head relative to the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""the print head""
Label (",S
I am sorry I am just thinking about I think there is probably a geometry that could do it with just one switch erm,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the other thing is that we",S
that when you come too far over erm the pen starts moving back in and so back in,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""so that the pen will be",Be
and therefore the switch comes off,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is a very important point because",Bs
before it looses contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that the pen stays in contact",Bs
you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so you can put the print",S
the outside bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the user will be holding the",S
yeah the thing that we did a few years ago,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it was a pen that was designed",S
which had a kind of sort of forced balanced print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

we tend to do fairly wide print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so we can do that with this",S
to try and keep them in contact with the medium,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""because of the wobbly",S
it appears a bit different less controlled,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the ink will flow""

it s like the old tape recorders is not it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is the idea that the pen",Bs
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so this will be a big issue",S
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

draws,D,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Label (JSON only):",Be
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""I think it would be a good",Bs
will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Text: ""and then you have got the",F
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""its going to be a bit",Bs
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""so its going to be er guarantee",F
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so you re saying the switch is",Be
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""the user needs to be able to",F
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the tip of the pen has",S
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""this is the one that is",Bs
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""to help the user hold the pen",Bs
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that it is in contact with",Bs
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so this is the standard plain",Be
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the user could then hold it like",Be
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and it s got a little bit",S
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so you write like that but this",Bs
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""it s going to be the same",F
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it's because the pen has a",Be
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""to draw and write""
Label",Be
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it is a very important part of",S
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it will be in the right angle",Be
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it will switch on with a resistor",Be
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""right handed mode then""
Label (",S
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""if you want to make a pen",S
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and that s the bit that s",Be
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and that is an idea probably for",Be
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the tip is a metal tip""",F
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""you can have a very small",Be
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so the main thing is to",S
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is a very simple device",Be
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""I think this is a plot a",Be
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""if you had to apply some",Bs
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""and it could be used for",Be
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the force is the mass of the",Be
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the pen can be used to create",Be
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and the other thing is the print",Be
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the main idea is to get the",S
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""it s a 3d",Be
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because it s the angle of the",Be
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the thing is that the angle",Be
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and then the other thing is",Be
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""I think it will be easier""",Be
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the head is basically a pen",Be
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""is a flat plate""
Label (",Be
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because of the flat base""
Label",Be
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and we re going to use the",Be
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""if the is like this it stays",Be
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""the pen is a good idea",Be
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so I m going to call",Be
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because its a very thin material""",Be
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""a simple switch here""
Label (",S
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # 
Text: ""based on this distance",Bs
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  # Structure (materials, parts, configuration),",S
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it is supposed to be a pen",S
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # correct answer
Text: ""it s",Be
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is supposed to draw a",Be
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the thing is that the design of",S
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""the one with the disc is",S
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it ll be more expensive than the",S
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""you can also use the other parts",S
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""the thing is that the heat",Bs
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so one edge defines too far right",S
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""for this purpose""
Label (JSON",S
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen needs to be held at",Be
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so that is a good starting point",S
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""and then you can have it",Be
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}  # Don't forget to return the JSON format",D
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we have to make sure that the",Be
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""D""} 

Text: ""on angular""
Label (JSON",D
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so the idea is that the pen",Be
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""you can have a switch between the",S
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we need to have a way to",Be
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""if you can have a design that",Bs
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and the bit you hold onto can",Be
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and that is a problem""
Label",Bs
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and we have got the standard thermal",S
but if its too far out it wont be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the pen is designed to be able",Bs
because its erm not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then you have got the weight",Bs
these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""we need to find out if it",Bs
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the problem with the pen is that",Bs
because they don t touch this outer angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""because it s the same shape as",Bs
yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so that is the problem we need",Bs
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s a bit of a compromise",S
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""because the battery is not going to",Be
but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so that s why the thermal paper",Be
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so you get the two"" →",S
you could just stick it on a on a rubbery pack or a film,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""so we can actually make it",S
sketching spring,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""what is the purpose of the sketch",S
I er,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the main advantage of this idea is",S
they start doing this sheath that hits first,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and the sheath is just a",Bs
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so th if you fix that she",Bs
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and then the air comes out of",Bs
so you can t do it quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so you can t do it quickly",Be
so you can t shock that thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so you can t shock that thing",Bs
that ll slo slow down and then it will slowly move back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""that ll slo slow down and",Be
yeah but then when you erm take it off the paper it quickly pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so I guess we need to think",Be
because this is a one way valve,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the pen is a one way valve",Bs
just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and it's also a very very",S
they will be air in there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it is a very difficult problem to",S
so that spring quickly returns it back down to it s protective position,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it is very difficult to get the",Be
so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s the angle of the pen",Bs
but as soon as you take it off it pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and this is the way it looks",Bs
so its just good point actually clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so this is the thermal pen",Be
I was just thinking that relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""and this is a bit of",Bs
so if we moves it round masks speech contact with the surface,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""this will be the second version of",S
its going to have quite a bit of momentum still so erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""it is going to be a",Be
quite hard or something that its pressed onto,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""we need to get the thing to",S
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so it needs to be protected""",S
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so it can t travel further forward",S
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and it s not going to be",S
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""this is a problem that is caused",Be
and then sort of smash onto something,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the reason for this is that we",S
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the design of the pen is",S
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Text: ""this is a problem because the",Bs
protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""this is a thermal paper and",S
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""because of the shape of the s",D
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it s the thermal ink in the",Be
yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because of the design of the pen",Be
no well as I say you need to shock that down ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so I was thinking of using a",Bs
you re smash you re gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath before this does anything in here,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""because you re gonna smash the",Bs
yeah also they re not that made out of ceramic and glass,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""so the main thing is to",S
mmm I think that is I think that the other other protective thing,F,"{""label"": ""S""}  # You should write your answer here


[",S
is whether they smash it off the table before momentum,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so I will just draw a little",Be
It s not it s not really kids sort of erm err throwing,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""it s not kids really sort of",Be
it down its also people dropping it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it ll be about fifty percent more",Bs
yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s not going to be any",Bs
yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""that would be good because it would",Be
then you can smash the edge of this,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Text: ""the first thing we need to",Bs
cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it so,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the force gets to here""
Label",Bs
or whatever that we could perhaps achieve holding this thing flat to the surface,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""because of the type of surface that",S
the foam pads is an idea actually you could imagine,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the foam pads are an idea actually",S
a foam pad with an aluminium carrier on the front of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the foam pad is very soft""",S
and the print head fastened to that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the pen tip has a diameter of",S
and it can just squidge around,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""it is not the only way",S
so yeah that would work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""erm it s the interaction between the",Bs
it would also give you some a really cheap way,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the cost of the pen is very",Bs
of achieving a reasonable force,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it has to be of a certain",Be
a great density foam,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and then it s the angle of",S
that could give you the force of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the idea is to have the",Bs
it could just recoil far enough it s a good idea actually,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and then the pen would still be",Be
that could work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the pen is a device that can",Be

aluminium print head on the bottom all connected,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the print head has to be on",S
I reck I reckon you move it around,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

yeah well you put this,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""in the pen and it is""",S
and it will just erm you have got spring and you have got some lovely,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so I think it is a good",Be
could you even take that one further,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""you re trying to make a",Be
like you could build the foam around the print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it's a bit like the thing",S
so you d have to press the foam back to actually reveal the print head in the first place,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and you d have to press the",Bs
so it almost wraps round a little bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and the base is made of plastic",S
so if you go like that bang the foam needs to,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so if you go like that bang",Be
perhaps not wrapped around to the extend in front of the housing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and the housing is the same size",S
so that you know you need to press the foam,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""it does not print well with this",F
bit in before you actually start touching it,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""it s a bit more expensive than",S
yeah you need the foam,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so it s a problem with the",S
to do some damping,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the mechanism is a damper""",Be
so that is got to go somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""because of the wobbly arm",F
yeah you need the foam to have tha that sort of this sort of,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""that affects position""
Label (JSON",Bs
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so what do you think we should",Be
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""because the pen has a large contact",Be
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""so that the pen is at",Be
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and then you d have to attach",S
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  # or other label

Text: ""because",Bs
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so we need to think of designs",S
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so that the user doesn t feel",S
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Text: ""it is just a matter of",S
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the one on the right the one",Bs
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the way the handle is",Bs
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""because of the weight""
Label (",S
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""we need to make sure it s",Be
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""so this is the original one the",Be
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the sheath was made of a",S
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""so we need to think of designs",D
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""is a very good idea""
Label",D
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the paper is the key""
Label",S
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the user should be able to easily",Bs
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""if the sheath has if the",Bs
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""that is a problem""
Label (",Bs
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""it is not a problem""",S
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""the idea is that the sheath",S
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""the actual printout is going",Be
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""it s a problem of the temperature",Bs
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # correct
Text: ""but the thing",Be
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""so we need to think of designs",Be
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it is the sheath that makes",S
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Text: ""this is a big advantage""",F
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the pen is a good idea because",Be
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it is used to write""
Label",Bs
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""the pen is made of plastic",S
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""D""}

Text: ""and that is what we are going",D
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""is it a pen or a marker",F
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""so we need to think of designs",D
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so we need to think of designs",S
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it ll be about fifty percent more",S
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it's a pretty straightforward thing""",S
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the shape of it is important""",S
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we want to create a pen that",Bs
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""this is the paper that we",S
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""and it is the same with",S
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so I think it would be a",S
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and the other thing is the print",Be
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""and the its not tha yeah",Be
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the mechanism is not as smooth as",F
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Text: ""it s the way you re",S
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""the print head is very small""",Bs
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""it s a great idea""
Label",Bs
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""and the other thing is the print",Be
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""because of the way the design is",Bs
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Text: ""we can see that the pen",Be
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Text: ""a thermal pen with a thermal",Be
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Text: ""the bit that you hold onto can",Be
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we need to make sure the user",Bs
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""and it will be in the middle",Be
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so the user has to put the",S
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""so the problem is that it s",S
