if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""if you like it s just its just",D
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}


Text: ""and there is a certain number",F
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""with a spring"" → Label (JSON",D
like a millimetre or so,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the first thing we need to think about",D
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""but then you have got to stop",Bs
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""F""}


Text: ""we re going to need a",F
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""this is actually the thing that will",Bs
that affects position,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""that affects position of the pen""
Label",D
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""what we re really talking about is that",D
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""it is not clear""
Label (JSON",D
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""you know it is to be in",F
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the problem is that the cylinder has to",D
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""and then the and then the cylinder",Bs
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": """"}


Text: ""it is not a good idea to use",D
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""that is what the user needs to",S
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""and then it would be an outer",S
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the one that is the real main""",D
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so the pen is able to move",Bs
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""and it is about five hundred grams",S
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""but it should be possible to make",S
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and we will have to use a",Bs
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""this is a pen with a she",S
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Text: ""you can draw on the paper",Bs
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the one on the left is the one",D
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""so that the pen will be able to",D
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""there are three different types of sheath",D
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""if the sheath has if the",Bs
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""the one that is the real main",Bs
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the one that is not working""
Label",D
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""erm so we need to make sure that",D
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""but one of the key things that we",D
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""D""}
Text: ""it is a sheath""
Label",D
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""so that it could be used as",Bs
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}


Text: ""now its a case of the",F
the sheath,S,"Text: ""it is""
Label (JSON only): 

Text: """,D
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""provides the spacing""
Label (",S
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""because the thermal pen is going to be",D
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""it is just a matter of the",S
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""that is the total weight of the pen",D
well is there anything else,S,"Text: ""and that is the thing about the thermal printer""
Label (",D
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""but erm it is really quite a lot",D
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""the thermal printer is a type of",S
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""and the user has to be able to",D
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the pen should be able to be carried",D
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""so we need to think of designs",Bs
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": """"} 

Text: ""it has a special pen""
Label",D
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""I think it is because of the",Bs
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""and the paper is involved in all",Bs
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""we need to think about the cost of",D
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""but its also about the media""
Label",D
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""we need to focus on the pen""",D
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""one thing that is important to me is",D
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the thermal printer is a very simple device",D
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""F""}


Text: ""so it’s about the thermal",F
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""it will be a good idea to",Be
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Text: ""because it is heavy""
Label (",S
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""because of the size and shape of the",D
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Text: ""the idea is that the thermal print",Be
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""the one on the right is the one",D
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

Text: ""so we need to think of designs",F
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Text: ""we need to think of designs that",Bs
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""what is the effect of the thermal pen",D
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Text: ""but that is not the only thing",Bs
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Text: ""so that the user can move the",S
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Text: ""the one on the top right is",F
