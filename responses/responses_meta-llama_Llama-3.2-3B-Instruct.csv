but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

Text",D
there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""it is very difficult to draw fine lines",D
so basically the first problem that we need to think about is the wobbly arm movement of the users,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

Text",D
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": """"}

Text: ""we will be testing the print quality of",D
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

Text",D
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

Text",D
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

Text",D
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

Text",D
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

needs to follow a contour,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

or needs to be able to adjust itself keeping itself in the same alignment,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}

even thought the user might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on that,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D>""}
