what s quite important is its about the thermal incli inclis pen,F,"To determine the correct label for the segment ""what s quite important is its about",N
but its also about the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so its the interaction between the special paper and the thermal pen basically ok,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
- The",F
but I know quite a lot of the briefing openly focuses about the print and things like that and obviously that is a key aspect of the brainstorm,F,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
but we should also not forget that the paper is involved in all of this as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
the one on the top left is the one that is the real main,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
focus of the of what we re doing today,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
that is the standard plain thermal paper err and then it can draw,F,"{""label"": ""S""}
```json
{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
its either atoms or line types er,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so for the process of making this prototype that is going to help us sell the project that is the concept really err design a a prototype umm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",F
the other ideas on the paper there were other concepts for a thermal pen which erm may form the ultimate product,Be,"To determine the correct label for this segment, let's analyze the content and see",N
but are not what we re going to prototype first,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's see. The segment given",N
erm so we may want to talk about those later,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
as a sort of broader,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
spectrum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
spectrum but the main focus is that style pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
where you will create a set of patterns by moving on plain white paper,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",F
will this be in colour,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
yeah well we should the impetus for this is that erm clients come up with this new rainbow media,S,"{""label"": ""F""}

F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",F
and we can print thermo reactive dyes onto er,F,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
media substrates and then when you heat them up they cool to reach the colour they re supposed to be,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} The segment describes the expected behavior of media substrates",Be
so erm we have done some test prints on this erm been tested by the HP boss,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
and playing with erm hot air miraculously a colour image appears erm out of a blank sheet of paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
so providing we could provide a heat source,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
then we could reveal anything which is printed on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's see. The segment is",N
now erm technically that is more demanding,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
because energising the entire printout takes time,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
You are a helpful assistant. You are a helpful",Bs
hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding thing to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so technically the stuff where you have got a low percentage fill sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",N
but if we could do that with the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
whether we could do that with this adaptation I don t know,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
the one on the right the one on the right does not actually have to be a thermal pen it could just be,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
JSON answer: {""label"": ""N""}",N
it could be a soldering iron,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,N
or a hot air,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's see. The segment given",N
there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
so basically the first problem that we need to think about is the wobbly arm movement of the users,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
  C",F
this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",F
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

The phrase",F
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,F
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

The segment",F
needs to follow a contour,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
The segment",F
or needs to be able to adjust itself keeping itself in the same alignment,Be,"To determine the correct label for the segment ""or needs to be able to adjust",N
even thought the user might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
is it only paper you re thinking about or could it be other things like mugs or fabric or pottery,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user is asking",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah I guess it could be all those,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
I ended up with the hold on sledge,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
the sledge excellent,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
write sledge,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The segment given is",N
so what did that generate then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
the sledge manages to keep level,BS,"To label the segment ""the sledge manages to keep level,"" we need to",N
by having quite a wide base,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
write wide base,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
a main force in the middle,BS,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's see. The segment is",N
unlike the set of skis,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
where quite narrow and you go up on an edge when you re turning,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
the sledge is er quite broad,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
write force in middle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
more often than say a sledge or a snowboard a skis or snowboard,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
so so would you potential see some some some guiders almost down the side of this,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
well I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
You are a helpful assistant. You are a helpful",Be
to have a set of stabilisers on it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",F

yeah no problem stabilisers like a bicycle yeah that is a good idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
write stabiliser,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

I was thinking that is sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast,S,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
yeah write Universal base ,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

i can't find the universal base",S
if the is like this it stays flat but the bit you hold onto can be at,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
JSON answer: {""label"": ""N""}",N
different angles,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
I guess the size of the thing in contact with the paper you could either have a very small contact area,S,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
and er track where it goes or you can have a wide contact area,S,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
show the relative size of the pen clears throat if you have got an example because that is,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
look at the end of that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
size is dictated by cost really it needs to be quite narrow,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be

there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
because they re on a spring and then you have got your central four points,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
here this is going to be up then if you go in that planeover an angle too much ,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
my arg what I was trying to say before is erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could do it with one switch,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Okay, let's see. The user provided",N
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

it's a whole lot easier to",N

erm and you know it's not",F
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N

its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N

yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N

The phrase",F
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

it s a little bit easier to",N
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",N
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
  C",F
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

The segment",F
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"To label the segment ""you will only need to touch that side"", we need",N
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} Here's the reasoning for the label choice:

The",Be
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",F
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  // The statement is vague and does not specify",N
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",N
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",N
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is:",Be

```json
{""label"": ""N""}

followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
i don't know what to say",N
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",N
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
  C",F
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided a",S
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
when you press the button it turns",N
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's see. The segment is",N
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The user provided the",N
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the window is in the front of",N
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
and it's got a switch on",N
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the switch is on the side",N
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's see. The user is asking",S
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,Be
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the edges here when they re when",N
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the cap is a tight fit",N
but if its too far out it wont be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
because its erm not touching,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"To label the segment ""these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in"",",N
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N

yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",F
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

so that you can have more control",N
you could just stick it on a on a rubbery pack or a film,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

the sheath is a soft rubber",N
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs

so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
You are a helpful assistant.

Okay, let's",F
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
The segment",F
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,F
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"To label the segment ""and provide an extra five hundred grams"", we examine it",N
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",S
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,N
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

The segment",F
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this labeling task. The",S
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} F — Function (purpose/goal)
  C",Be
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)

The segment",F
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,N
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,N
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
```json
{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""F""} F — Function (purpose/goal)  
The",F
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's see. The segment is """,F
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Bs
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",Be
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""N""} F–Be–Bs–S Labelling Guide",N
