what s quite important is its about the thermal incli inclis pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but its also about the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so its the interaction between the special paper and the thermal pen basically ok,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
but I know quite a lot of the briefing openly focuses about the print and things like that and obviously that is a key aspect of the brainstorm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",F
but we should also not forget that the paper is involved in all of this as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the one on the top left is the one that is the real main,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
focus of the of what we re doing today,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the goal is to understand what the",N
that is the standard plain thermal paper err and then it can draw,F,"{""label"": ""S""}
Alright, let's break this down. The segment",S
its either atoms or line types er,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so for the process of making this prototype that is going to help us sell the project that is the concept really err design a a prototype umm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
the other ideas on the paper there were other concepts for a thermal pen which erm may form the ultimate product,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but are not what we re going to prototype first,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
erm so we may want to talk about those later,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
as a sort of broader,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
spectrum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
JSON answer: {""label"": ""N""}
JSON",N
spectrum but the main focus is that style pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
where you will create a set of patterns by moving on plain white paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
will this be in colour,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah well we should the impetus for this is that erm clients come up with this new rainbow media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
and we can print thermo reactive dyes onto er,F,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""and we can print thermo reactive d",F
media substrates and then when you heat them up they cool to reach the colour they re supposed to be,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""media",N
so erm we have done some test prints on this erm been tested by the HP boss,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
and playing with erm hot air miraculously a colour image appears erm out of a blank sheet of paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's break down this segment: """,N
so providing we could provide a heat source,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
then we could reveal anything which is printed on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
now erm technically that is more demanding,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because energising the entire printout takes time,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""because",F
hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding thing to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so technically the stuff where you have got a low percentage fill sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
but if we could do that with the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
whether we could do that with this adaptation I don t know,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the one on the right the one on the right does not actually have to be a thermal pen it could just be,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it could be a soldering iron,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or a hot air,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""wh",N
there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so basically the first problem that we need to think about is the wobbly arm movement of the users,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",F
this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",F
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",F
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",F
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
needs to follow a contour,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
or needs to be able to adjust itself keeping itself in the same alignment,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""or",F
even thought the user might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment is a question expressing uncertainty or seeking input",N
is it only paper you re thinking about or could it be other things like mugs or fabric or pottery,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah I guess it could be all those,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
I ended up with the hold on sledge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
the sledge excellent,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write sledge,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so what did that generate then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the sledge manages to keep level,BS,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
by having quite a wide base,S,"{""label"": ""S""} The segment ""by having quite a wide base""",S
write wide base,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
a main force in the middle,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
unlike the set of skis,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
where quite narrow and you go up on an edge when you re turning,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""where quite narrow and you go up",N
the sledge is er quite broad,S,"{""label"": ""S""} The segment ""the sledge is er quite broad",S
and then you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The segment mentions ""weight right in the middle""",Bs
write force in middle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
more often than say a sledge or a snowboard a skis or snowboard,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so so would you potential see some some some guiders almost down the side of this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""so",N
well I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
to have a set of stabilisers on it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
based on the idea of a sledge,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
designed for heavy duty use",F
yeah no problem stabilisers like a bicycle yeah that is a good idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
write stabiliser,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
I was thinking that is sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah write Universal base ,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
if the is like this it stays flat but the bit you hold onto can be at,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
different angles,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I guess the size of the thing in contact with the paper you could either have a very small contact area,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
and er track where it goes or you can have a wide contact area,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
show the relative size of the pen clears throat if you have got an example because that is,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
look at the end of that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
size is dictated by cost really it needs to be quite narrow,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment mentions ""needs to be quite narrow,""",F
I imagine it to be that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} (because the segment is vague and doesn't clearly",N
could be a that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
lets just use that as guidance but let us,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
tip of that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""tip of that"" is too vague",N
rather than the rest I would suggest,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it can be te ten mil across,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""it",N
it s a erm its not an edge one then it s a it s a on the flat there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
are two flats printing are not there more than one,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""are two flats printing are not there",N
one,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Segment:
two

JSON answer: {""label"":",S
while drawing if I where yeah the resistors sit on the lump there,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the nib is a bit soft but",N
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 1,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
and you have got the type where the resistors sit on this corner here,S,"{""label"": ""N""} I think the label should be ""N"" because",N
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 2,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""it",N
no its not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
it's a great pen for the",N
it ll be about fifty percent more expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yes this there is an end,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""there",N
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""so you normally have a a slight",N
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw angle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so we were talking mostly about that one or that one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that one sort of plus or minus,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the tip is made of metal",N
all these you have to keep flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
the tip is made of a porous",F
its just its just whether we need flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
draw circle draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
and then you had a tracker like an optical mast then,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw box draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
I think that picture where you re moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment. The user",N
instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just do a thin line at a time,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Wait, let me check again. The segment says",F
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but when you scribble backwards and forwards it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
would build up and use that tracking capability to do that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",F
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and you would not have the angle problem,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah the problem is that printing on the ball,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""so its like instead of being a",N
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Segment:
this is a very high quality product",N
we did that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the pen is designed to draw thin",N
with the dots though very very small,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
to be used with the pen",N
you can only they ve got such low they will last thermal mass,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""you",N
you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but you can make it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""but you can make it"" is",N
clears throat erm at the moment what we have got available for a demonstrator is one of the types on the left,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so we do have this constraint of what that angle needs to be ,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
the angle is constrained by the need",F
so that is going to,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
that angle here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yes that is going to limit us for the time being,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
to keep the to hold on to rather than actual hands are stabilised like a platform,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment describes the purpose or goal of the design",F
Sarah refers to a photograph,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that has an angle joint,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
and a guidance for your fingers,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and similar to the windsurf,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
to reduce the risk of the pen",N
I mean it only moves in one axis,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""I mean it only moves in one",N
rather than round,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it does not its almost flat is not it I suppose,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
yeah it does not move that way I do not think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
It is designed to draw thin technical",N
cos you want to keep flat on the paper all the time,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
does the razor stay flat though,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because the centre piece is much,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Segment:
due to the ink being very visc",Bs
I am not sure whether it does completely stay flat I think there might be a little bit of a plain,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
but its main axis is is that the razor has is that way I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
write razor,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if I if I remember correctly from I don t know about this but from the other razors each blade has like a little spring down each side,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
which means each blade can independently of housing can move that way a little bit as well cant it so that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

The segment discusses the functionality of the blade's",F
draw E1_7 Sketckjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
how s that achieved that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
It is designed to allow the user",N
is that is that achieved by a plastic,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this labeling task. The",N
that is bendable or is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this query. The segment",N
no it s a spring is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
a spring that goes to surface,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
it pivots,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
write spring pivot,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
there is f five of the razors is not there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I have brought some examples along there is one with a single spring in the centre there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""I",N
and then there is one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
these are electric ones yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the ink flows smoothly through the pen",N
these are electric razors and so this is,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
slightly more expensive version that is got a spring either side,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""sl",S
yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
they do yeah there is its one with the foils basically because on this the foil is sprung this one is well no,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the foil will run through rubbers and it uses the the cutting edge that is sprung,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Bs
erm there is a point here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
as well that erm do we need to keep because this will keep an even well a relatively constant pressure won t it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment. The user",N
and you could also you could add a switch to this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so you could switch it on and off,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well because,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it comes on how you want it to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""it",F
so is that what you call a gimble,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
gimbles are normally three dimensional,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I ve got another one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it builds on another one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it goes faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
but as well its erm one of the things about this is that you have got the main lump,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""but",N
and then you have got steering piece towards the front which is banging near microphone drowns speech,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment mentions a ""steering piece"" that",N
so you have got,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
to make sure that the ink flows",N
I guess you have kind of got the main unit that has got all the power and weight in it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then erm the flexible bit that does the steering,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but considering we re talking about toys in effect for children,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

something else that gets pulled behind it for example,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
something that is much more of a quite a different shape that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
holding the pen at the right angle,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
that is probably one of the things you want to teach a child though is not,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah well you could take all of the difficult stuff off them and make it happen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
all that they will do is move the lump around,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write move lump,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so you will teach them how to move a mouse about,F,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",F
if there is a skill in that there is a sense of achievement,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we could have like a mouse rather than a pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that could just be a different starting point,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write mouse type pen,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
all they have to do is put it on the table then move it around,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it does everything else,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I was thinking a different media than just a flat piece of paper,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a pens quite a nice sort of you know to get round angles and,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
do you think a mouse would allow you to apply that constant force that we need for this though,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this query. The user",N
I don t see why not I mean as long as the force is not going to push the mouse into the table then gravity should be on your side should not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The user",N
can I just clarify that you mean for the main lump to have all the sort of the weighty bits like the batteries and electronics and things like that or the that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment. The user",N
I was not really being that prescriptive,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you ever go without it s not too bad but,F,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the tip is made of porous material",N
the means of a toy I have a quick problem because well I do not know,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like a ghost err it is a little ghost it s about you know an inch high,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

The segment ""draw it"" is vague and",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg top left 2 sketches,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
what its got inside is its got errr and I can t remember exactly what its got inside its got a rubber err a wheel,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg top left 2nd sketch,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
which printed on it has a little erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I don t know why I am telling you all this because its not really,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you mean one of those foot print things,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} I think the segment is irrelevant. It seems to",N
its got its got little footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
rotating,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah it s a self and yeah its got a pad an inky pad here and he,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
does that go all over the walls and everything,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you walk it along a page,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it makes footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is interesting cos I was thinking pastry brush you know how pastry has,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
and white line machines,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but I could not think of anything that quite tied into this but the idea of a wheel,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}  (vague opinion)

Segment:
that would",N
pushing a wheel along,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is a obviously this is a mechanical way of doing what we re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so it could the thing could look like erm like a character could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure this out.",N
I guess this idea Tom was that this is the print head here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle bottom circle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and this quite a wide like a caravan is that angles that can hold that to feel it because,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw u to represent print head and caravan,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""draw",N
if you know if he goes crr crrr mimics scraping noise then this digs into the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle bottom arrow represents digs into the paper,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment describes an illustration or diagram where an arrow",N
so you could even have three wheels could not you three small wheels to sort of drive it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""so",F
write wheels to guide,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle circle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and you could have a cross section it could be kind of kind of like this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle m,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
so you can look down here and you can see a hole with the print head in it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so see where you re going,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle details,D,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""draw refDocumentE1_3",N
you could stick three ball bearings in here and,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle 3 circles within circle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and just roll around on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you put in holes to see where your feet are going,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
its just so you could acquire lots of stuff where you re actually marking,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
yeah its sort of it s a compromise between erm here with a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you want to see what you re doing don t you you want to see,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but with this type of toy you don t do you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
probably aware pattern appears as an edge so you can go right up to,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
rather that the middle of something big if its big than it does not matter much so long as its at an edge of the big thing where the,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment. The user",N
but even with paper suppose you could still get to it its not like hoovering a room when you can t get to an edge is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""but",N
it becomes more complex to the user as well you can rotate it so you can get to this corner or,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's break this down. The",N
rotate it to get to that one,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it is an interesting idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
add some wheels to it,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
add some wheels to it

JSON",F
I bought erm a tram,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""I bought erm a tram"" does",N
well the distance between the rails and the what I was thinking the distance between the rails and the overhead wires always changing as it has to follow this articulating,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",Bs
yeah nice idea,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it is a bit like the suspension on a car,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
as well the car sort of has this inertia it flies along in a straight line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
with suspension and all sorts of things as the wheels pump up and down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""with",N
as well stay in contact with the road if you have got a decent car,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well that is that is the other thing I suppose we haven t considered anything like erm air pockets,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
or anything like that that could be like a little suspension,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""or anything like that that could be",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg 3 lines left ie bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
suspension,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is the sort of thing about children they do things jerkily quickly,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
use a gyroscope,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
gyroscope,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""gyroscope"" is a noun referring",N
write GIROSCOPE and Air suspension,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
stick a big gyroscope in it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""stick",N
so they cannot jerk it around,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah ok that is a good idea Tony,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we should have a target aged child here should not we,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
to because erm well I think well erm like this I say about this obviously it was not a problem,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
if you do not if you do not let it gimble that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
then you would get you can make your own lines cant you you can make different thicknesses,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg 2 lines right ie top,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so so it might if the if the applications for somebody who got,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""so",N
then you add a feature by taking out you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah because if if if if erm yeah if say if the the pen is printed in just dotted lines,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg dotted line right ie top,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you can you can if this pen if you do not let it go that way you could make it print dotted line print dotted line,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment is a fragmented and unclear statement about a",N
oh so you just have you just have one print out one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
one one nozzle dot touching,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so I guess what you re saying is any mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you can have it switch on switch off one could be easy line and then you can switch it off so that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
you could,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
write vary the angle to have different width of line,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The segment mentions ""vary the angle to have different",Bs
you could use it just so at the corner of the printer head,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
the pen would be able to write",F
well you could do that just electronically by activating one of the channels on the print heads,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
write or do this electronically,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think that is the way to do it because,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
otherwise you can overheat the print head and might damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so part of the thing here is we need to erm hold it down,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
otherwise it going to overheat as its firing if there is no where for the heat to go,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Segment:
the trigger is a very small trigger",Bs
could we put erm can we detect the heat that the,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and therefore switch it off,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
with a 3.0 mm",F
or know what s going on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
er that is only going to stop it getting dangerously hot,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",F
all we need to do for print quality and performance and things,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
is to keep those dots on the paper when they re being fired,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
the other thing which you will picture sort of erm to an extent that one as well is the actual steering erm is actually,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
at the moment the hand steers it directly by making movements with the hand,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",F
but if you had like a joystick,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that then moved the angle of the print head errm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that might work too but maybe a bit more expensive I suppose,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think the interesting thing is to use is as they steer that its built into the steering,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
actually tilts the whole body as it steers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""actually",Be
so in order to maintain that angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
write integrate the steering into angle like snowmobile,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""write",N
it compensates for the lean of the rider into the corner,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",F
so it s flat,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  (purpose: to be flat)
Okay,",F
so if we had something like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} I think the segment ""so if we had something",N
you could steer this angle of the pen as it moves to the other end,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
or you take all the opportunities for control away from people apart from moving around,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and you make the pen or whatever it is do everything,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
the pen is designed for drawing thin",F
erm or we give some feedback erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so that people know when they re doing the right thing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""so",F
write feed back to user when doing it right,D,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""write feed back to user when doing",F
erm or the last one is it is possible to hold it the wrong way,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""erm",N
but it forces you to hold it the right way possibly base on shapes,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment discusses the requirement for holding the pen in",F
write make the shape so it can only be done one way,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""write",F
well for the the third you can make it erm hard make it compliant to,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I know I know what you re saying but it would be difficult,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because you would overheat the edge of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""because",Bs
if its not touching,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but there could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads overheating it must be touching at the other end,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
so I shall switch this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah probably there must be some way of detecting that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
can I just explore that last one in a little more detail,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because when organisations,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
making sure they can only be correct in one way so the design and shape of the thing,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""making",F
so it can only be done in one way and that s the correct way,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
because then there is less sort of learning to be done by the user and children I think if they are you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if they don t get the results pretty quickly they will just give up on it erm,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
so it would be quite good shape of,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it would only let it work in one particular way,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",F
you could build it in different ways so you could have it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so that there was only one way of doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
but then err you can have switches on it so that supposing supposing it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you have got the print head and three balls around it to support it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
with pressure sensors on those balls,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
so if the child presses harder it activates all the bearings,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""so if the child presses harder it",F
and prints out a very erm heavy line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
but if the child does not press hard then you activate every other one,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Bs
so you get a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
write interaction between how child presses so activation of print head,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so clears throat the actual kind of the erm the print head is isolated from what the child s doing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the actual kind of the erm the",N
but the sensors,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
attend to what the child s doing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and the thing responds accordingly,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
and so you can trick the child into doing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
and you could also make it so that even if the child s because erm clears throat its not direct you can make it sort of software,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
so that even if the child s really uncoordinated basically you get a reasonable result,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""so",F
but if the child s very coordinated you can actually do some quite sophisticated things,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
you could even have sort of some feedback,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
in terms of colour LEDs on the pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
saying that he s done a good or she s done a good job or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is a bit that is a bit peachy I think somehow,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah you know because i if they re doing something and it produces a result,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure this out.",N
that is what they want is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
that is what they want and saying well done is not really you know so what,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
spirit level in the pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""spirit level in the pen"" does",N
3D spirit level the dot and the ring you the dot,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
write spirit level in the pen,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
if it goes off centre you know the dots outside the ring,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the pen would not work,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""the pen would not work"" is",N
so you have got to come in,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
could we sorry could we actually see what they re doing I mean,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
are they drawing pictures or making invitations or Christmas cards or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
as well as electronics,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and some of the control,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and user interface features and things whereas,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
erm this kind of functional end of the mechanics,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
it does affect a little bit,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""it does affect a little bit""",N
control draw,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah because its really hard to draw a picture with a mouse is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have games built into it could not you,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have something like colouring in,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
could try and tell you on some screen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or try some sort of coordination task,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is a huge amount of possibilities you could do mazes or anything with,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
once more let us explore this spirit level in more detail I corrected the transcript,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because the other thing that you use to make sure things are level,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is come out in the sort of DIY world is these laser levellers and things like that if,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you had like a little laser,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that made sure that it was level of some sort erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you know the child can actually see a line,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and that its at the right angle then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because they can see that the line is right and then that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
although maybe they are a bit young for that laugh,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could project something onto the paper in front of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
write Laser level,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like dam busters,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write Dam busters shine a light in front of,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
just like star wars,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
actually see its got the pattern it creates separates into two areas,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so its when it s actually on the surface two points meet,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""so its when it s actually on",N
if you lift an optical mouse,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
slightly off the page you will see the pattern it creates,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah sort of the triangle thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is in two sort of distinct spots,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and when its actually sat on the surface they match up and that is when it starts tracking,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""and",Be
write use optical mouse mechanism,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
turn the light on I don t know how to operate,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah well if you left it a few minutes,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
when you talked about the little light in front of the erm pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but if there is sort of feedback from the print head to know its in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
and then the light goes on only but only when the print head is on there is this little light comes on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""and",N
so the child gets his feedback that way oh its in the right direction so I can draw,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
I think if I was in their shoes using this I d prefer they d be something where I decide whether its in the right position,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Okay, let me try to figure out the",N
or whether I want something lighting up and saying der derrr,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
that kind of thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the ink spreads

JSON answer:",N
well there is a bit of training there is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Segment:
well there is a bit of training there",N
write Light,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
true but it its kind of patronising to have these sort of lights,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
its not a comforting a comforting noise,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
its not its not its not a comforting noise,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
The thing I bought with me my wife does not know I stole it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
also quite relevant because that is a product from,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
stabiliser that is just come out,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if I run upstairs I have got one of those in my drawer,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
there are pens that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""there are pens that"" is incomplete",N
you do have to hold in a certain orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah I think that is what I tried its really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
because I don t hold my pen in the way that they expect you do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
they expect you to some people write like this don t they,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is what I join my fingers up at the top where as that one expects that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you do more of that which I don t do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is because you did not have that pen when you were little,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you had had it you would write in the right way rather that the wrong,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
you would do it properly,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you get inking pens,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that are really hard to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because they look they look like little erm they they they go straight down like that sketching,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
so that the user can write easily",N
draw Document E1_3Sketcjjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""draw Document E1_3Sk",N
you could have thumb holes or something like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}? 

Okay, let's break this down.",N
this this this one that is this one has sort of that sort of thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
it does not force you to use it but it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
helps you,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
to use straight up and down otherwise they don t otherwise they don t work,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
because they work thr they th they re like a little er tube,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""because they work thr they th they",N
and when you push on it erm it opens a valve which lets the erm which lets the ink through,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Bs
is that those gold and silver type things,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that people use for making cards,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
no it s like you get them for erm drafting pens,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think work like that they have got they re like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
because they they come in different bits of tube,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
and they give you a very accurate width of line,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment ""and they give you a very accurate",F
OK but you cannot you cannot use them in any orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you have to use in straight up and down,BS,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
and so if you put it on the edge the you would go on the edge of the tube,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The tip is porous, so the",N
and it just it would just sort of it just the edge just goes on,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
you will never get it you just crease the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback s inherent is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
if you re not doing it properly it wont work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""if you re not doing it properly",N
it will probably it will probably be that if you do it on the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the PCB,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
and you ll lift the whole the whole thing off,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""and you ll lift the whole the",N
so you probably wont be able to do this this sort of touch towards the edge,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because the print head the resistors are in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""because",Bs
PCB yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
just the kind of thing that you could do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
with the erm styling,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
for the user to write with",N
so it just feels right you not do you are limited to what you can do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you put your fingers in the wrong place,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and if we cut all that for I mean this version,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it could be much chunkier,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and this thing could go in the hole this lot could go in the hole,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and perhaps you can mirror it so it works for left handed people as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but you could just make a hole to hold it in either way,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
this is the same as the standard",N
you d have to certainly with the first go realize where to put their fingers,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
it might not even work,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if one of their fingers is not in the right hole,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
also you feed it back to the wrist,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is all different things,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah hand sizes as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you know you could you feed it back,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
it can be used to draw thin",N
so its kind of like a watch or something on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well you could have a battery pack in that could not you,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or a rucksack,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or a rucksack laugh,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
laugh ghostbusters,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write battery pack on wrist,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""write",N
write mould the unit to right position for,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""write",F
if you have got if you have got a switch there there there and there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
draw Document E1_4Sketcjjpg crosses indicate position of switchs,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""draw Document E1_4Sk",N
and it only works if all four switches are down,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment ""and it only works if all four",F
and those switch positions guarantee that the head is down then,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah that is the control approach is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah that is the yeah and you design it in such a way that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is a reasonably comfortable position,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and if you don t put it in that position,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
you can t get the lines to",N
it does not work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it d be nice though if you naturally pick it up and it works,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah but that is you can do the two together can you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the other thing to to think about is in almost all cases when I look at pens the apart from re wired sort of micropens,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the th tip is actually the narrowest part of the product,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
whereas in what we re looking at it could actually be as wide or wider,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""whereas in what we re looking",N
so its more like a paintbrush is not it like a DIY paintbrush,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s more like a roller like a roller yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
its there is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you had like if you if you had it connected to one side like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or a it would be here the print head you could have then going to there then going to there is,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that you don t smudge it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it would have flexibility because of the metal on which it s hinged if you like,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break down this segment: """,Bs
yeah I think actually I wonder if you intuitively know how to use a roller,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because you re older than eleven and intuitive if you have never seen it before,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
my two year old rolls paints,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but I think it could be the pen I mean it could be we could shape it so it does make it like a finer tip,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
yeah but there is an inherent size issue with holding it this way is not there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Okay, let me try to figure out the",N
because you re not going to have you you you used to have these pens that were ginormous and,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
it had lots of different pens inside it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
yeah and they re all like this round,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it made it really difficult to write with at the right angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
so I think there is an issue about how big or how,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
big,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you might not hold it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah I think that is worth considering it actually,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
the not having it in a pen shape,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the not holding it like a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but actually holding it in a different way like that or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah there are two there are two sides to this I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
either you want to teach children to hold a pen properly,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
if you wanted to do that you d give them a,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah but you have got to be taught how to hold a pen,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
a lot better as write like this as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""a lot better as write like this",N
different people will write,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
with not smudging the ink,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Segment:
with the ink staying fresh for longer",Bs
different people will hold the pen between these two fingers and write like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""different",N
they should not be allowed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is it a training aid or toy that we re is it for fun,F,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment is asking a question about the purpose of",N
its for fun,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
its mainly really for fun really I think erm,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because if you want to teach a child something about pens,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
you d give them a pen would not you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
no well it depends it could be funit could teach you something,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
an added bonus I suppose,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it could teach you something else,F,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
to be able to draw thin technical",N
its going to be quite a fat lump probably,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
so it s not going to be that kind of pen that you use in future,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
so it does not feel much like a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
you know it could I think it could be more of a decorator s thing you know,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you want to put a row of smilies in,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
paper and pen along the edges of you know,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
on the wall,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you re never gonna draw a whole pic you re never gonna draw paint the Sistine chapel,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""you",N
no you d need more batteries,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
its more of sort of decorative kind of features,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
things like that you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is another degree of freedom to this thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you go fast it will be a paler colour,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break down the segment: """,Be
if you go slowly it will be darker wont it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
yeah if you go fast well maybe if you go fast if there is no feedback from the paper it does not matter how fast its going,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
then it might produce gaps but it might produce gaps in places of,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the thing would be cool,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you drive it faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""if",N
that mark is the same as that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
so that the user can easily identify",N
that is what you will end up with but erm you won t end up with a long smooth line erm that is faint erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
definitely gaps in it head on all the time you don t have the head on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah you could turn it off off and on very fast could not we,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
for the usefulness er well I am just I am just trying to think about what erm what the pen does really erm,F,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
if it s if it s a if its fun its got to do,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
sort of a wider range of features,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
features somehow,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think it might self regulate,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think people might visit around how does it work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
or they use it more slowly I think that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but I am thinking it will it will be more fun,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you can get something you know if you can get a faint line or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you had a drawing there that you did was that for any particular purpose,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
I ve seen a pen that somebody s created,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
where its actually got this kind of loop in it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so that if you hold it with your index finger actually through this,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
and the thumb, you can write",F
so it s you you almost wear it like a glove,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
deep breath in yeah or like a sort of ring on your finger with the pen attached to it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out how to",N
but it forces you to hold it in a very specific way,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
um that is intriguing sort of like a like a could be like a finger puppet could not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah cos wearing it like a finger puppet,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the feel of it might be fun,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
exactly so you can make you can make the footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
I I think I think the sort of design not very good at,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
Tom does that help regulate the angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that would also tie in quite well the sort of cyber view,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} This segment is a vague opinion about how well a",N
of having a pack on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or sort of cyber arm is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
thermal print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
The segment ""thermal print head"" refers to a",S
lightning coming out of his nose,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is the issue of left and right handedness erm how we re going to resolve that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
can you turn the print head round or,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it does not matter because as long as you have got as long as you have got features that can be either mirrored features the same on each side,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment provided is: ""it does not matter",N
you have got them all like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you have got some area to work with and then,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you have to keep the area of the mirror image,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
quite good,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""quite good"" is a vague opinion",N
in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it is not even a pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because a pen you you will always learn to write from left to right whether you re left handed or right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so actually what you end up doing is left handed people is you smudge over over your work which is a problem,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
you have to make sure that the",F
but actually with this you re dragging it you re not pushing it are you most people will drag it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
mostly dragging it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
mmm because you were wired to drag it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""mmm because you were wired to drag",N
will be dragged,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
that is an interesting point,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
mmm so you want a design then to sort of force people to drag,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""mmm so you want a design then",F
it which is not something you do with a marker pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you draw a line when you drag,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
generally you might do with a marker pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
but if you want to make it",N
with a marker pen you tend to drag yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but what I am saying is the analogy of teaching people to write is not actually valid in the sense that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
when you re writing you re not actually dragging usually apart from if you re right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you re right handed you drag,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
a pen that writes smoothly and doesn",N
if you re left handed you push,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so do they do a left handed version of this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that s more interesting cos commercially lost that would be a loss leader just about,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well it must it must cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
its gonna cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but schools or something schools must buy two sets,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""but",N
yeah its not worth its not really for schools,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well they had that in my school when I was in primary school everybody had a red fountain pen and I had a special green fountain pen because I was left handed,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
erm protecting the print head which I haven t really thought very much about,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but as it it might be a nuisance or bad thing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
to have the print head projecting down out of the bottom of this most of the time,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
because it may catch on things like the edge of the table or something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and so erm perhaps there is something else a rounded lump or something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
as it approaches the page causes the print head to come down,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
The segment ""as it approaches the page causes the",Bs
which may carriage be sprung also,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like a see saw,S,"{""label"": ""S""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",S
comes down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like a nodding birds yeah,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""like a nodding birds yeah""",N
if you have your printing head ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""draw E1_4 Sketchjpg",N
and you have got you have got your spring like that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
and you have got a switch or something here ,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
that you can change the line weight",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg",N
and you have got a case there ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The ink flows smoothly and evenly from",N
and then when you you can only push this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then when you push this up so that all the faces are touching,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""and then when you push this up",N
that is when the switch goes,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
erm so you get so so what this is is is maybe this is not erm err susceptible to knocks and things because its on a sp spring,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah and you get protected by a case,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
but the other thing is the opposite of this being here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and these two things being on springs,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""and",Bs
so that when these get pushed back,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
they ll spring back and then they will switch on the,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""they ll spring back and then they",N
that is true that works as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
that works even better cos it s not leaking its protected then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Bs
a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""} The segment ""a sheath"" refers to a",S
a print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
yeah do you need to stop the print head going sideways,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
draw arrow not sure which drawing,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""draw",N
cos you want it to travel forwards when its going that direction,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah you don t want people to go that that that is an interesting point,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
put wheels on the side to make it,S,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""put wheels on the side to make",F
I I don t think there might not be a problem with that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
in fact it might be something that they might want to do to produce interesting effects,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
distorted smiley faces,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and I think we might get away with that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
but what if what if a child held the pen can I just borrow that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
rather than holding it width ways,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""rather",N
so this is across the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
thinking of holding it that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
providing just enough pressure,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
providing probably be alright,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but we could try and stop them from doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.

The segment ""but we could try and stop",N
it is sort of like a its like a calligraphy pen is not it if you erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because you get thick you get thick and thin,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""because you get thick you get thick",N
because you get the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that business of withdrawing the print head when it s not in use or something like that,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
well yeah well it s a sheath is not it that is the word you said was not it a sheath that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a sheaf,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write sheath protecting the head,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Segment:
sleek and compact, ideal",S
or it could be deployed on contact or something,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the ink is delivered through the nib",N
OK it is fundamental the other thing that I am now going to look at is ,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
two two problems one is over pressurising the print head on the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or abuse of the pen so somebody could go like that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and that will probably break it and,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
does not fix that does it er no the sheath does not fix that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
you go like that you hit the printer,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
whereas the other way round bangs table,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well the sheath protect that is not it so,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
the sheaths so spring both and the things happen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
yeah so expect there is more travel if you smash there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
Draw 2 crosses over Tom s sheath Document E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah that means you can t move both yeah yeah that is right yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so I its what AJ suggested that this moves back,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
to to start to as a switch,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
whereas the alternative is for that to move back,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the alternative is to have it move",N
well I suppose you could design it such a way as it only goes,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
at a certain speed back so if you went if you just went like that it would go back quite,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
slowly but if too quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""slow",N
you you could have them both moving back and,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have you could balance springs and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have viscous back,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
with a replaceable ink cartridge",N
if that thing s on a spring and that is on a,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
Draw unknown sheet,D,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""Draw unknown sheet"" is vague and",N
of some sort which could be quite simple,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
viscous,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""viscous"" describes a property",N
write viscous damper,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
and if you bang it down its effectively solid,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
leaking syringe,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""leaking syringe"" is a",N
cheap syringe,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write leaky syringe,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
where s the sheath gone,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The pen has a 2.",N
heat source,S,"{""label"": ""S""} The segment ""heat source"" refers to a component",S
laser light,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
any other ways in which we could try I mean we could put a cap over it that is how other people do it ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment. The user",N
that is way too low tech for this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that will protect it but it still is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
what about a cap,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like a spring loaded cap,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} The segment ""like a spring loaded cap"" describes",S
that comes out of the way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""that",N
yeah like a button there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that s nice yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's look at this segment: """,N
write sprung loaded cap,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
that that slides the,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the button,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
then it could not get lost could it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Segment:
it is not possible to lose it",N
mmm it could also turn off the comforting hum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's break this down. The",N
when you put the cap back on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The pen has a built-in cap",N
I quite like the idea of a comforting hum,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a comforting hum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write comforting hum,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
when it s working right,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
what like a sings dum dum dum dum dum dum,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like rolf harris,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the cap is quite interesting though,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because if it hinges that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it will make people much more likely to to drag it across there if it s clear as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
yeah but you can still see things or,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you had not just an activation button not an,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
a button that is activated by the",N
activation button but a button that made the print head come out,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
a non a non clickable pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so you had to you know obviously not up there,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""so you had to you know obviously",N
you can only write when it s up,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you if you go like that it would sort of go out a little bit,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
and then if you push it up it would go out more,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
I mean you can still damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so it s a it s a dead man s handle for a pen basically,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
write a dead man handle for the pen,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
you could have a little slider on it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
could it could do this kind of thing round the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""could",N
yeah yeah and then and then you coul it could just be sprung,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then when you put it down its held open by,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then any pressure on the tip,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
it s more is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
you re not going to be using it for hours on end are you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s for little pieces of,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
I would say long car journeys though,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have a and that open up,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's break this down. The segment",N
draw,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a little bit annoying on long car journeys laugh,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have a cap that goes like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
draw,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then you could also have the same spring here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that any force by a certain amount would force the cap to shut again,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
a force that is applied to the",F
a double action cap,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
so you button but it s got an override of pressure,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",F
on the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Segment:
with a replaceable refill

JSON",S
I am thinking of something a bit like erm the flap on a video tape,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
uh huh what the flap,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like a garage door type of thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah push the button then it goes open,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
write garage door type mechanism,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but that is probably overly complicated,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
garage door,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well it could be a roller,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a roller door,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
write roller door,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""write roller door"" does not clearly",N
as you cool that down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the pen writes smoothly

JSON answer",N
yeah a button here that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is a slider that opens the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",S
but then regardless of whether you have got the button pressed down or not you press hard and it comes back down,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment says",N
so it does not matter if you drag it thuds hand on table it ll just,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or you just keep that button pressed but,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
thud yeah if you re very sort of cover that comes down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
are you just whacking this pen there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s got a cap on,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""it",S
how much did that pen cost,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
errrr well about five pence or something,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah is that refillable,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
like this is not refillable,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I assume it has a cover that comes on as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is nice it s erm holdable,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so one one pence two pence six pence,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""so",N
twenty pence,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could put a time delay on it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""you could put a time delay on",N
that is a good way of protecting it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write time delay,D,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
you could say it has to be in contact with the paper for a second and then the thing will deployed,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""you",F
that is easy,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""that is easy"" is vague and",N
and that way it s protected from being banged,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Wait, let me think again. The segment """,F
is there is there an issue anyway erm guys with there being or having to be or a benefit by having like a stand by mode,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment. The user",N
so its either completely switched off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
with or without the cap on it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""with",N

Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
where its sort of semi warm but its ready for action quickly,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
it has a home so a docking station,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
we could charge it in there as well plus,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it might be over budget,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah so a docking station what would the docking station look like charge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write docking station cradle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well it would just be a cradle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it would just be somewhere for it to live when you re not using it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
like a little protector like an inkwell,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
laugh like a quill,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this labeling task. The",N
a quill that means it s not something that you could put in your pencil case,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""a",N
well I think there is an issue actually there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
as well with children sometimes using lots of types of pens at the same time,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you had erm written something or smudged something with some other type of err pen or even a,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
pencil or a crayon or something like that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then you used this on the same paper would it make the print head dirty,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
and would there need to be some way of cleaning the print head potentially,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
or would it be good to have some way of cleaning the print head,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""or would it be good to have",N
like we could have a cap on it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that actually erm sort of goes past it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is there any danger if you got ink from another pen or paint can it short,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it would not short it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""it would not short it"" is",N
it would not short it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but it might burn into the head so,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

The segment ""but it might burn into the",Bs
the good thing you could clean this you can get,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""the",N
a crayon would be all right because that would melt,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
you can clean it but erm I have got a way of cleaning it with a knife,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
but paint would be a problem would not it you d imagine that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could clean it off but you could not get the kids to do it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
unless you er unless you did it automatically,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N

or its got to be got to be depressed,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
imagine you have piece of metal,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
spring switch,S,"{""label"": ""S""} I think the segment ""spring switch"" is best",S
is there a could you measure I am thinking of for example if a child decides to try to write on his clothes or on their skin or whatever,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
erm it may not be such a good idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
erm potentially feedback,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
how quick the how quick the head cools down if its on the actual paper its supposed to be on versus if it was on some different media sort of,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Segment:
the pen is not able to draw",Be
how hot,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
how hot does it get,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
err it does get quite hot well,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
the tiny dots can get quite hot,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} The segment ""the tiny dots can get quite hot",Be
and there is next to no thermal lapse,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} The segment ""and there is next to no thermal",Be
so they cold again very quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} The segment ""so they cold again very quickly""",Be
if you wear it on your skin it would just be,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we need to test this but I,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
mechanically the the,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
mechanically the the

JSON",N
well there is potential for a safety issue,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but erm where you re going trying to detect a cooling rate from the media,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that you have been in contact with can be a very hard thing to do erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but detecting the media or detecting that you re on some kind of media,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""but",N
or holding station or something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
cos it could be sold as it could be a thing you put your special media on or,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and we could either detect that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} I need to label the segment ""and we could",N
or we could look for erm translucent dots buried in the erm media or something,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
write translucent dots,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or you could they you could a they could be like er beads switches,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you can only write on a magnetic plate is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah you could do that or looking for a signal or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or detecting a change,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""or detecting a change"" is vague",N
so this is what you re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
errr yeah its more systemy,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I guess beyond the actual pen you could imagine all sorts of systems where,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
mmm ok you re tied you re tied to the media anyway so it s not really,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
erm yeah you re probably not constrained,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because you unless you are detecting something special about the media which you might want to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} I think the segment is a bit unclear. The",N
the effects of the media then it would work on any thermal media or,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is not common is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
like printers,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
fax machines,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the mechanism might look like,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment is unclear and does not clearly fit into",N
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""if",N
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
and then they could stay,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
do they really need to stay in contact well,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""do they really need to stay in",F
if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
The segment ""if you don't press hard enough",Bs
edge and if you go over it if you come too high an angle,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
but what you cant do is it can t the print head can t tilt back or forward because these slots are in,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment. The sentence",Bs
they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
this this stays at a fixed angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Segment:
it can be used for both right",Be
it can move up and down,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
and side to side its fixed that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
the print head relative to the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
I am sorry I am just thinking about I think there is probably a geometry that could do it with just one switch erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that when you come too far over erm the pen starts moving back in and so back in,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
and therefore the switch comes off,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
before it looses contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
the outside bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
yeah the thing that we did a few years ago,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
which had a kind of sort of forced balanced print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""which",Bs
we tend to do fairly wide print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
to try and keep them in contact with the medium,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
it appears a bit different less controlled,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and on that we basically had a frame,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
which brought the print head down brought the print head down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then that is right and so,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
like this and then,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
it s like the old tape recorders is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it finds its own level,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment ""it finds its own level"" indicates",F
and the force is applied to this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is right the print head just like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
on a carrier as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
could it work this way as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
no,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
what you always want to combine is something that when you press you press media,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so that you have made contact,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
circuit you over pressurise it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it goes past it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so it does not work and then you have got you have got bottom out,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""so it does not work and then",N
sheath here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
brilliant idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and could you use these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Segment:
the contacts are made from a nickel",N
and put them in 3D,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
could be one could be one here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
and there,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""and there"" is a conjunction and",N
we only need two in the front and back,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so that as well as being in the right vertical position ie actually touching paper,S,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""so that as well as being in",F
so that it dissipates heat not press too far,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""so",F
because then it pops out the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Bs
and you re over pressurising it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but also something to do with the fact that these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if if as you say go over an angle then you notice that central thing comes away from one side,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
you know the distances between the edge of these ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""you know the distances between the edge",N
the distance between the edges of these things and the outer casing,S,"{""label"": ""S""} I think the segment is describing the physical configuration or",S
when you re at a small angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
they move a little bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Be
when you re at a big angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
one sides hard up against it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the other one produces a gap and so you can almost have that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""the",Bs
could you have that front and back as well like a sort of cross,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then you have to have all four things contacted like what you said earlier so,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""if",N
because they re on a spring and then you have got your central four points,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
here this is going to be up then if you go in that planeover an angle too much ,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
my arg what I was trying to say before is erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could do it with one switch,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""you could do it with one switch",N
if if the casework say the casework is comes out f further out errm ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure this out.",N
the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""the",Bs
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""it",F
so that so that when it it does not actually erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
draws,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""is",N
will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",F
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""because",N
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""allows",N
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""or if you drag right handed along",N
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""to",F
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The segment ""because it will touch that side""",Bs
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""if it s on left handed mode",N
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""then",F
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} (because it's about the purpose of the mechanism",F
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's break this down. The segment",N
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""but it s about it s about",N
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
to be able to write at an",F
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break down this segment: """,N
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

The segment is unclear and does not clearly fit",N
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""a",N
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",F
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
the sleeve is made of a therm",F
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
the tip is made of a very",N
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but if its too far out it wont be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
because its erm not touching,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} I think the segment ""it also wont be working",N
because they don t touch this outer angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",Bs
yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""depend",F
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this labeling task. The",N
you could just stick it on a on a rubbery pack or a film,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
sketching spring,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I er,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
they start doing this sheath that hits first,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
The segment describes a specific action (""push that in",Bs
so you can t do it quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
so you can t shock that thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
that ll slo slow down and then it will slowly move back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
yeah but then when you erm take it off the paper it quickly pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Bs
because this is a one way valve,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The segment ""because this is a one way valve",Bs
just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
they will be air in there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so that spring quickly returns it back down to it s protective position,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment ""so that spring quickly returns it back",F
so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break down this segment: """,F
but as soon as you take it off it pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}? Or is it ""Be""? The segment says",S
so its just good point actually clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I was just thinking that relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment says",S
so if we moves it round masks speech contact with the surface,S,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let me try to figure out the",F
its going to have quite a bit of momentum still so erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
quite hard or something that its pressed onto,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""quite",N
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}.
Okay, let's tackle this segment: """,F
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
The segment ""or it could hinge forward under its",F
and then sort of smash onto something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""im",N
protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
no well as I say you need to shock that down ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you re smash you re gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath before this does anything in here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah also they re not that made out of ceramic and glass,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",S
mmm I think that is I think that the other other protective thing,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is whether they smash it off the table before momentum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
a pen that needs to be used",N
It s not it s not really kids sort of erm err throwing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
It needs to be reliable, durable",N
it down its also people dropping it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Okay, let me try to figure out the",N
then you can smash the edge of this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it so,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment provided is a fragmented and incoherent",N
or whatever that we could perhaps achieve holding this thing flat to the surface,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
the foam pads is an idea actually you could imagine,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a foam pad with an aluminium carrier on the front of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
and the print head fastened to that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
and it can just squidge around,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so yeah that would work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
that's probably the best way to",N
it would also give you some a really cheap way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
of achieving a reasonable force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
a great density foam,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
that could give you the force of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
it could just recoil far enough it s a good idea actually,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
that could work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
a big sponge,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
draws,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
aluminium print head on the bottom all connected,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Segment:
for a smooth print

JSON answer",S
I reck I reckon you move it around,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah well you put this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and it will just erm you have got spring and you have got some lovely,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
and it will just erm you have",N
could you even take that one further,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like you could build the foam around the print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
so you d have to press the foam back to actually reveal the print head in the first place,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so it almost wraps round a little bit,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""so",Be
so if you go like that bang the foam needs to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",F
perhaps not wrapped around to the extend in front of the housing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""perhaps",N
so that you know you need to press the foam,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
bit in before you actually start touching it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""bit",N
yeah you need the foam,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
to do some damping,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
so that is got to go somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
yeah you need the foam to have tha that sort of this sort of,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
where where it does not want to move fast,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""where where it does not want to",N
well has to be down,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
we could we could have some sort of air bladder,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I think it probably could be rubber,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
obviously,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
yeah the stuff they make wrist supports for erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like the jelly stuff,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah the gel,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""yeah the gel"" is too vague",N
yeah well gel does that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah techno gel,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the only p gel,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we ve talked a little about air cushions,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and the sort of syringe type mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
any other ways that we could use sort of air pockets of some sort to,S,"{""label"": ""N""} The segment ""any other ways that we could use",N
you could make a magnetic force it in the middle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
pellets,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
The segment ""pellets"" does not clearly fit",N
so it stays sort of stays,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}  (as in 'purpose' of the feature",F
pushed into it yeah you could do something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
magnets not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
air pockets are much cheaper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well that does not have to be that could be a balloon inside,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah you could put a it on a pneumatic bladder in,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah or like a sort of bridge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""yeah",N
or you could do what they do in an old fashioned mouse not optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
with the b ball,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
just use gravity because it s own weight makes it roll on the mouse mat,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} The segment mentions ""use gravity because it's own",Bs
that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
five hundred grams is that wh is that the,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
oh you need five hundred grams OK that is fi,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
you need five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
how far s five hundred grams,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
er er yeah if you take it to twenty mill,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
sort of half the compression that will be,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
I did not realise what this was this is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",N
it s a prototype model,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s not really a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
a product that is not really a",N
well its test,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
to explore,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
why do you need that force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this query. The segment",F
err expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
for contact is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
for use with a ballpoint pen",N
well if you well if you well if you have got heat here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and here its zero contact is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
yeah so you need quite a strong contact basically,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} I think the segment ""yeah so you need quite",F
well if you have got a so if you go to ten mils instead of five,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
the tip is so small that the",F
well then you re going to have a,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's take a look at this segment",N
a switch on,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that is what one of the questions was the other switch goes past there we want to wa,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
one you re inside the protective thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
two it s not got power,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
no power, no light

JSON",N
this is really difficult is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
yeah it will be like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
but its very similar,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s just for the skilled personnel to use in their lab,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} The segment ""it's just for the skilled personnel",F
the print quality in a way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
what is the range of angles,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s just to measure what you what the parameters are,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
like a millimetre or so,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""it",N
that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",F
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""you",F
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} I think the segment ""still get a sense of",N
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
i mean, the thing is,",F
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this segment: ""erm",N
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
with a felt tip for better control",F
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Segment:
provides the spacing

JSON answer",S
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",N
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment given",N
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",S
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

The segment ""yeah that is twenty mils",N
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let me try to figure out the label",N
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""it",N
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}.
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment",Be
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",F
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} The segment ""you have got to keep the paper",Be
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
a smooth, consistent ink flow",N
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
Okay, let's break this down. The segment",Be
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
Alright, let's tackle this segment: ""or",N
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Okay, let's tackle this. The segment is",N
