what s quite important is its about the thermal incli inclis pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but its also about the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so its the interaction between the special paper and the thermal pen basically ok,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but I know quite a lot of the briefing openly focuses about the print and things like that and obviously that is a key aspect of the brainstorm,F,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Because the segment is talking about the focus on",N
but we should also not forget that the paper is involved in all of this as well,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment refers to the paper's role as",S
the one on the top left is the one that is the real main,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit into any category.",N
focus of the of what we re doing today,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is the standard plain thermal paper err and then it can draw,F,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
its either atoms or line types er,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so for the process of making this prototype that is going to help us sell the project that is the concept really err design a a prototype umm,F,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment discusses the purpose of making",F
the other ideas on the paper there were other concepts for a thermal pen which erm may form the ultimate product,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but are not what we re going to prototype first,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but why is that the case?",N
erm so we may want to talk about those later,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
as a sort of broader,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
spectrum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
spectrum but the main focus is that style pen,F,"{""label"": ""S""} because it refers to the structure of the pen (",S
where you will create a set of patterns by moving on plain white paper,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment says """,S
will this be in colour,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah well we should the impetus for this is that erm clients come up with this new rainbow media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Because the segment is talking about the reason or motivation",N
and we can print thermo reactive dyes onto er,F,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is """,S
media substrates and then when you heat them up they cool to reach the colour they re supposed to be,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so erm we have done some test prints on this erm been tested by the HP boss,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and playing with erm hot air miraculously a colour image appears erm out of a blank sheet of paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so providing we could provide a heat source,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
then we could reveal anything which is printed on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
now erm technically that is more demanding,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
because energising the entire printout takes time,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Because the segment discusses the function or purpose of",F
hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding thing to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment describes the function of the batteries,",F
so technically the stuff where you have got a low percentage fill sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but if we could do that with the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
whether we could do that with this adaptation I don t know,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the one on the right the one on the right does not actually have to be a thermal pen it could just be,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
it could be a soldering iron,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or a hot air,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, is ""hot air"" a known",N
but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
so basically the first problem that we need to think about is the wobbly arm movement of the users,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Wait, why is that? Let me think",N
this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let's break this down.

The segment",N
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",F
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because 'needs to' indicates function.

Wait,",F
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
```",F
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}? Or is there a better fit?

Let me",N
is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Because the segment is indicating the purpose or goal of",F
needs to follow a contour,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment ""needs to",F
or needs to be able to adjust itself keeping itself in the same alignment,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
even thought the user might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Because the segment is vague and doesn't fit",N
is it only paper you re thinking about or could it be other things like mugs or fabric or pottery,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah I guess it could be all those,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I ended up with the hold on sledge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the sledge excellent,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because ""sledge"" is a part,",S
write sledge,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because 'write' is a verb, but",S
so what did that generate then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the sledge manages to keep level,BS,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment is about the purpose of",F
by having quite a wide base,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
write wide base,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because the label is describing the structure (the",S
a main force in the middle,BS,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
unlike the set of skis,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
where quite narrow and you go up on an edge when you re turning,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
the sledge is er quite broad,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment describes the structure (the sledge",S
and then you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  
Step-by-step explanation: The segment talks about",Bs
write force in middle,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because the action is to write, so it's",F
more often than say a sledge or a snowboard a skis or snowboard,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, why? Let's think through.",N
so so would you potential see some some some guiders almost down the side of this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because the segment is talking about the structure of",S
to have a set of stabilisers on it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is """,S
based on the idea of a sledge,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because the segment refers to the structure of a",S
yeah no problem stabilisers like a bicycle yeah that is a good idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
write stabiliser,D,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The word 'stabiliser'",S
I was thinking that is sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah write Universal base ,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 
```",S
if the is like this it stays flat but the bit you hold onto can be at,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
different angles,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I guess the size of the thing in contact with the paper you could either have a very small contact area,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
and er track where it goes or you can have a wide contact area,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: 'wide contact area' is a",S
show the relative size of the pen clears throat if you have got an example because that is,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
look at the end of that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
size is dictated by cost really it needs to be quite narrow,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I imagine it to be that,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 
But wait, the segment is ""I imagine",F
could be a that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is vague and doesn't fit into",N
lets just use that as guidance but let us,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
tip of that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
rather than the rest I would suggest,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, that segment is ""rather than the rest",N
it can be te ten mil across,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, but according to the guide, S",S
it s a erm its not an edge one then it s a it s a on the flat there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to figure out why the segment ""it",N
are two flats printing are not there more than one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
one,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Is this correct? Let me think again.",N
while drawing if I where yeah the resistors sit on the lump there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 1,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment 'draw",S
and you have got the type where the resistors sit on this corner here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 2,D,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't fit into",N
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because it's unclear and doesn't match any category",N
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
no its not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it ll be about fifty percent more expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yes this there is an end,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""yes",N
there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is vague and unclear, not fitting",N
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment 'draw refE1",S
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit any category. It",N
draw angle,D,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Because ""draw angle"" directly indicates a function",F
so we were talking mostly about that one or that one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that one sort of plus or minus,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
all these you have to keep flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
its just its just whether we need flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
I think I should try to figure out why",N
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the segment is describing a part or structure",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because ""both axes"" refers to the structure",S
yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""yeah",N
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw circle draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and then you had a tracker like an optical mast then,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw box draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I think that picture where you re moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just do a thin line at a time,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The segment discusses the printer's behavior",Be
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but when you scribble backwards and forwards it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
would build up and use that tracking capability to do that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
and you would not have the angle problem,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah the problem is that printing on the ball,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Reasoning: The segment mentions 'printing on",S
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
- The segment is '",N
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The segment mentions making the print width",F
we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment 'we've done that",F
we did that,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
with the dots though very very small,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you can only they ve got such low they will last thermal mass,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but you can make it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
But wait, the segment is ""but you",N
clears throat erm at the moment what we have got available for a demonstrator is one of the types on the left,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
so we do have this constraint of what that angle needs to be ,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Explanation: The segment talks about a constraint on",F
so that is going to,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is incomplete and doesn't provide a",N
that angle here,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because it's vague and doesn't fit any category",N
yes that is going to limit us for the time being,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
to keep the to hold on to rather than actual hands are stabilised like a platform,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
Sarah refers to a photograph,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Because the segment refers to a photograph, which is",S
a man s shaver,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because 'shaver' is a part, and",S
that has an angle joint,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
and a guidance for your fingers,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and similar to the windsurf,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment is describing the structure or attribute without",S
I mean it only moves in one axis,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The segment describes the movement, specifically",Be
rather than round,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it does not its almost flat is not it I suppose,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""it",N
yeah it does not move that way I do not think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
cos you want to keep flat on the paper all the time,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
does the razor stay flat though,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because it's unclear what the razor's function,",N
because the centre piece is much,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I am not sure whether it does completely stay flat I think there might be a little bit of a plain,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because the segment is a statement about potential imper",N
but its main axis is is that the razor has is that way I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
write razor,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
if I if I remember correctly from I don t know about this but from the other razors each blade has like a little spring down each side,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
which means each blade can independently of housing can move that way a little bit as well cant it so that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} (but let's see why)
Analysis: The",N
draw E1_7 Sketckjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't fit any",N
how s that achieved that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
is that is that achieved by a plastic,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is bendable or is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
no it s a spring is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
a spring that goes to surface,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation: The segment describes a part, a",S
it pivots,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

I think the word ""pivots""",S
write spring pivot,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is f five of the razors is not there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I have brought some examples along there is one with a single spring in the centre there,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment describes the structure of the",S
and then there is one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
these are electric ones yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
these are electric razors and so this is,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
slightly more expensive version that is got a spring either side,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Reasoning: The segment mentions a spring on",S
yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Wait, but why? Let me think through",Be
they do yeah there is its one with the foils basically because on this the foil is sprung this one is well no,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}",Bs
the foil will run through rubbers and it uses the the cutting edge that is sprung,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation: This segment describes the structure (the",S
erm there is a point here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Step-by-step explanation: The segment ""erm",N
as well that erm do we need to keep because this will keep an even well a relatively constant pressure won t it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and you could also you could add a switch to this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so you could switch it on and off,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} because it's about the expected behaviour of the device",Be
yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well because,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it comes on how you want it to,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  
Explanation: The segment discusses how a part (",Bs
so is that what you call a gimble,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""so",N
gimbles are normally three dimensional,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
I ve got another one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it builds on another one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and it goes faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
but as well its erm one of the things about this is that you have got the main lump,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then you have got steering piece towards the front which is banging near microphone drowns speech,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so you have got,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I guess you have kind of got the main unit that has got all the power and weight in it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because the segment is a vague statement about power",N
and then erm the flexible bit that does the steering,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
write snow mobile ,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
draw E1_7 Sketckjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
where I know we re talking about a pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment refers to a pen, which is",S
and you immediately think about something that is this sort of shape that you can hold in your hand like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but considering we re talking about toys in effect for children,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
could it be something that takes more of the shape of a of a train with,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""could",N
something else that gets pulled behind it for example,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
like a drag on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
something that is much more of a quite a different shape that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
does not require them to have that difficult sort of hold,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
things in place like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
because that is one of the challenges children have is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
holding the pen at the right angle,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation: The label 'S' is assigned",S
that is probably one of the things you want to teach a child though is not,F,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Wait, but the segment is ""that is",N
yeah well you could take all of the difficult stuff off them and make it happen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
all that they will do is move the lump around,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so you will teach them how to move a mouse about,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
if there is a skill in that there is a sense of achievement,F,"{""label"": ""F""}  # F - Function (purpose/goal)",F
we could have like a mouse rather than a pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
that could just be a different starting point,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step:

1. Read segment: """,N
write mouse type pen,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
- The segment is 'write mouse",S
all they have to do is put it on the table then move it around,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment describes a function by stating what it",F
and it does everything else,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I was thinking a different media than just a flat piece of paper,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
a pens quite a nice sort of you know to get round angles and,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
do you think a mouse would allow you to apply that constant force that we need for this though,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is a question",N
I don t see why not I mean as long as the force is not going to push the mouse into the table then gravity should be on your side should not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
can I just clarify that you mean for the main lump to have all the sort of the weighty bits like the batteries and electronics and things like that or the that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
I was not really being that prescriptive,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you ever go without it s not too bad but,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""if",N
the means of a toy I have a quick problem because well I do not know,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
like a ghost err it is a little ghost it s about you know an inch high,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg top left 2 sketches,D,"{""label"": ""S""} Because the segment describes the structure or parts, mentioning",S
what its got inside is its got errr and I can t remember exactly what its got inside its got a rubber err a wheel,S,"{""label"": ""S""}.
</think>

```json
{""label"": """,S
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg top left 2nd sketch,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
which printed on it has a little erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
I don t know why I am telling you all this because its not really,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah you mean one of those foot print things,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
its got its got little footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
rotating,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} because it's about the behaviour without specific parts.",Be
yeah it s a self and yeah its got a pad an inky pad here and he,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
does that go all over the walls and everything,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you walk it along a page,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation:
The segment is about the behavior of",Be
and it makes footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is interesting cos I was thinking pastry brush you know how pastry has,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and white line machines,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but I could not think of anything that quite tied into this but the idea of a wheel,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
pushing a wheel along,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the action of pushing a wheel along is the",F
that is a obviously this is a mechanical way of doing what we re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so it could the thing could look like erm like a character could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Step-by-step explanation:

The segment provided is",N
I guess this idea Tom was that this is the print head here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle bottom circle,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and this quite a wide like a caravan is that angles that can hold that to feel it because,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, why is this labeled as N?",N
draw u to represent print head and caravan,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you know if he goes crr crrr mimics scraping noise then this digs into the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle bottom arrow represents digs into the paper,D,"{""label"": ""N""}?
Wait, that's the initial thought, but",N
so you could even have three wheels could not you three small wheels to sort of drive it,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the statement is about the purpose of having wheels",F
write wheels to guide,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is about the purpose of the wheels",F
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle circle,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because it refers to the structure of the document.",S
and you could have a cross section it could be kind of kind of like this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle m,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment 'draw refDocumentE1_",S
so you can look down here and you can see a hole with the print head in it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment describes the structure where the",S
so see where you re going,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle details,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation: The segment refers to a part or",S
you could stick three ball bearings in here and,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg middle 3 circles within circle,D,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment is describing a structure (",S
and just roll around on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Because the segment ""and just roll around on",N
you put in holes to see where your feet are going,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
its just so you could acquire lots of stuff where you re actually marking,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah its sort of it s a compromise between erm here with a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you want to see what you re doing don t you you want to see,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is a vague statement without a clear",N
but with this type of toy you don t do you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
probably aware pattern appears as an edge so you can go right up to,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
rather that the middle of something big if its big than it does not matter much so long as its at an edge of the big thing where the,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.
Because the segment is vague and unclear, with",N
but even with paper suppose you could still get to it its not like hoovering a room when you can t get to an edge is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

But why? Let's see.

The segment",N
it becomes more complex to the user as well you can rotate it so you can get to this corner or,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
rotate it to get to that one,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
it is an interesting idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
add some wheels to it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Reasoning: The segment 'add some wheels",S
I bought erm a tram,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well the distance between the rails and the what I was thinking the distance between the rails and the overhead wires always changing as it has to follow this articulating,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment discusses the distance between rails",Bs
yeah nice idea,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it is a bit like the suspension on a car,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because it's a vague analogy, doesn't fit",N
as well the car sort of has this inertia it flies along in a straight line,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

But wait, the user is asking me to think",N
with suspension and all sorts of things as the wheels pump up and down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
as well stay in contact with the road if you have got a decent car,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} (example)
````

Alright, I need to",F
well that is that is the other thing I suppose we haven t considered anything like erm air pockets,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
or anything like that that could be like a little suspension,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg 3 lines left ie bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
suspension,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
that is the sort of thing about children they do things jerkily quickly,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment describes an",Be
use a gyroscope,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because 'use a gyroscope' indicates the function",F
gyroscope,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
write GIROSCOPE and Air suspension,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, but why? Let me think through",S
stick a big gyroscope in it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so they cannot jerk it around,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah ok that is a good idea Tony,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
we should have a target aged child here should not we,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The segment is a question prompting to",F
to because erm well I think well erm like this I say about this obviously it was not a problem,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if you do not if you do not let it gimble that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
then you would get you can make your own lines cant you you can make different thicknesses,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg 2 lines right ie top,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so so it might if the if the applications for somebody who got,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
then you add a feature by taking out you know,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
yeah because if if if if erm yeah if say if the the pen is printed in just dotted lines,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't fit any",N
draw refDocumentE1_3Sketchjpg dotted line right ie top,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure or configuration of something",S
you can you can if this pen if you do not let it go that way you could make it print dotted line print dotted line,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
oh so you just have you just have one print out one,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
one one nozzle dot touching,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, why is this labeled 'S'?",S
so I guess what you re saying is any mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Wait, but why? Let's think.",N
you can have it switch on switch off one could be easy line and then you can switch it off so that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Wait, why is that the case? Let",F
you could,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
write vary the angle to have different width of line,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  
Explanation: The segment discusses changing the angle to",Bs
you could use it just so at the corner of the printer head,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well you could do that just electronically by activating one of the channels on the print heads,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
write or do this electronically,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because the instruction is to write or do something electronically",F
I think that is the way to do it because,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
otherwise you can overheat the print head and might damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so part of the thing here is we need to erm hold it down,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, but why N? Because the segment is",N
otherwise it going to overheat as its firing if there is no where for the heat to go,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Step-by-step explanation:
The segment discusses the",Be
could we put erm can we detect the heat that the,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
and therefore switch it off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but let me think again.

The",N
or know what s going on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
er that is only going to stop it getting dangerously hot,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is: '",N
all we need to do for print quality and performance and things,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment is describing the overall structure (print",S
is to keep those dots on the paper when they re being fired,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
```",F
the other thing which you will picture sort of erm to an extent that one as well is the actual steering erm is actually,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to analyze this segment to determine the correct",N
at the moment the hand steers it directly by making movements with the hand,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the description is about the expected behaviour of the",Be
but if you had like a joystick,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Because the segment is a description without any clear function",N
that then moved the angle of the print head errm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
- The segment is """,N
that might work too but maybe a bit more expensive I suppose,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is discussing the cost, which could",N
I think the interesting thing is to use is as they steer that its built into the steering,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.

But wait, let's analyze the segment.",N
actually tilts the whole body as it steers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
so in order to maintain that angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the phrase indicates a function or purpose ('to",F
write integrate the steering into angle like snowmobile,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it compensates for the lean of the rider into the corner,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Wait, why is this labeled F? Let",F
so it s flat,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so if we had something like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you could steer this angle of the pen as it moves to the other end,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 
```",F
its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or you take all the opportunities for control away from people apart from moving around,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and you make the pen or whatever it is do everything,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
erm or we give some feedback erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so that people know when they re doing the right thing,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function, indicating the purpose",F
write feed back to user when doing it right,D,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment says 'write feedback to",F
erm or the last one is it is possible to hold it the wrong way,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but it forces you to hold it the right way possibly base on shapes,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
write make the shape so it can only be done one way,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because the action is to create a shape with a",F
well for the the third you can make it erm hard make it compliant to,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't fit any",N
I know I know what you re saying but it would be difficult,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is: """,N
because you would overheat the edge of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}",Bs
if its not touching,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because the segment ""if its not touching""",N
but there could be some electronics maybe saying this end of the print heads overheating it must be touching at the other end,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so I shall switch this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah probably there must be some way of detecting that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
can I just explore that last one in a little more detail,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
because when organisations,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
Because the segment is vague, as it doesn't",N
making sure they can only be correct in one way so the design and shape of the thing,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, but the segment says ""making sure",S
so it can only be done in one way and that s the correct way,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Wait, why? Let me think through.",N
because then there is less sort of learning to be done by the user and children I think if they are you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if they don t get the results pretty quickly they will just give up on it erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so it would be quite good shape of,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
it would only let it work in one particular way,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Reasoning: The segment discusses how the system",Be
you could build it in different ways so you could have it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
</think>

```json
{""label"": """,N
so that there was only one way of doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is indicating a function or purpose,",F
but then err you can have switches on it so that supposing supposing it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you have got the print head and three balls around it to support it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Reasoning: This is a description of the",S
with pressure sensors on those balls,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation:
- The segment refers to the presence",S
so if the child presses harder it activates all the bearings,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} because the segment explains that the child's action (",Bs
and prints out a very erm heavy line,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The phrase 'and prints out a",Be
but if the child does not press hard then you activate every other one,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so you get a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The segment 'so you get a",F
write interaction between how child presses so activation of print head,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment discusses the purpose or function of how",F
so clears throat the actual kind of the erm the print head is isolated from what the child s doing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but the sensors,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the segment 'but the sensors' refers",S
attend to what the child s doing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the purpose or function of something",F
and the thing responds accordingly,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
and so you can trick the child into doing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and you could also make it so that even if the child s because erm clears throat its not direct you can make it sort of software,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so that even if the child s really uncoordinated basically you get a reasonable result,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
but if the child s very coordinated you can actually do some quite sophisticated things,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you could even have sort of some feedback,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
in terms of colour LEDs on the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
saying that he s done a good or she s done a good job or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is a sentence",N
that is a bit that is a bit peachy I think somehow,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah you know because i if they re doing something and it produces a result,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is what they want is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is what they want and saying well done is not really you know so what,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
spirit level in the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's a part of the pen, describing",S
3D spirit level the dot and the ring you the dot,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is '",S
write spirit level in the pen,D,"{""label"": ""S""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""write",S
if it goes off centre you know the dots outside the ring,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Wait, but the segment says ""if it",N
the pen would not work,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because the pen not working is a function issue.",F
so you have got to come in,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment 'so you have got",F
could we sorry could we actually see what they re doing I mean,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is a question",N
are they drawing pictures or making invitations or Christmas cards or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
as well as electronics,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
and some of the control,F,"{""label"": ""S""} 
because the segment refers to parts or materials without",S
and user interface features and things whereas,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
erm this kind of functional end of the mechanics,F,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Because the segment is talking about the function or",F
it does affect a little bit,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the segment describes how something behaves without mentioning a",Be
control draw,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",F
yeah because its really hard to draw a picture with a mouse is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you could have games built into it could not you,F,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function of the device.",F
you could have something like colouring in,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step:
1. **Identify the",N
could try and tell you on some screen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or try some sort of coordination task,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is a huge amount of possibilities you could do mazes or anything with,F,"{""label"": ""N""}.
</think>

```json
{""label"": """,N
once more let us explore this spirit level in more detail I corrected the transcript,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Alright, let's break down this segment step",N
because the other thing that you use to make sure things are level,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Because the segment is talking about ensuring things are",Be
that is come out in the sort of DIY world is these laser levellers and things like that if,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you had like a little laser,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment ""you had like a little laser",N
that made sure that it was level of some sort erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment talks about ensuring something was at a",F
you know the child can actually see a line,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and that its at the right angle then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
because they can see that the line is right and then that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the segment discusses expected behaviour without reference to specific",Be
although maybe they are a bit young for that laugh,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you could project something onto the paper in front of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
write Laser level,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because ""write"" indicates the function of the laser",F
like dam busters,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
write Dam busters shine a light in front of,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is about the purpose of the Dam",F
just like star wars,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
erm I was going to say an optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let me think again. The segment is",N
I was going to say an optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you lift it off the page you can,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
actually see its got the pattern it creates separates into two areas,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure or configuration of the",S
so its when it s actually on the surface two points meet,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} or similar.

Alright, let's break down the",F
if you lift an optical mouse,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

slightly off the page you will see the pattern it creates,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

and when its actually sat on the surface they match up and that is when it starts tracking,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the cue is about expected behaviour ('starts tracking",Be

Wait, why is ""write use optical mouse mechanism",N
turn the light on I don t know how to operate,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}.

Wait, let's analyze this segment: """,Be
yeah well if you left it a few minutes,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
when you talked about the little light in front of the erm pen,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but if there is sort of feedback from the print head to know its in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then the light goes on only but only when the print head is on there is this little light comes on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so the child gets his feedback that way oh its in the right direction so I can draw,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
I think if I was in their shoes using this I d prefer they d be something where I decide whether its in the right position,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Wait, but let me think again. The",N
or whether I want something lighting up and saying der derrr,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
that kind of thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well there is a bit of training there is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
write Light,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Step-by-step explanation: The segment ""write",S
true but it its kind of patronising to have these sort of lights,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
its not a comforting a comforting noise,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N

The thing I bought with me my wife does not know I stole it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

also quite relevant because that is a product from,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
stabiliser that is just come out,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Explanation: The segment is 'stabiliser that",N
if I run upstairs I have got one of those in my drawer,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
there are pens that,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the segment refers to the structure (parts",S
you do have to hold in a certain orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah I think that is what I tried its really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to explain why this is N. The",N
because I don t hold my pen in the way that they expect you do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
they expect you to some people write like this don t they,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is a",N
that is what I join my fingers up at the top where as that one expects that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you do more of that which I don t do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is because you did not have that pen when you were little,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you had had it you would write in the right way rather that the wrong,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you would do it properly,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the instruction is about the function or purpose.",F
you get inking pens,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because ""inking pens"" refers to a part",S
that are really hard to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
because they look they look like little erm they they they go straight down like that sketching,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw Document E1_3Sketcjjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
you could have thumb holes or something like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment suggests an optional",N
this this this one that is this one has sort of that sort of thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because this segment is vague and doesn't fit",N
it does not force you to use it but it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
helps you,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment ""helps you"" indicates the",F
print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, why is that? Let me think",S
to use straight up and down otherwise they don t otherwise they don t work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because it's unclear or too vague.
But the",N
because they work thr they th they re like a little er tube,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and when you push on it erm it opens a valve which lets the erm which lets the ink through,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Step-by-step explanation:

1. Analyze",F
is that those gold and silver type things,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
that people use for making cards,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
no it s like you get them for erm drafting pens,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
I think work like that they have got they re like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
because they they come in different bits of tube,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and they give you a very accurate width of line,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because the line width is a structural aspect,",S
OK but you cannot you cannot use them in any orientation,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let's think.

The segment is:",N
you have to use in straight up and down,BS,"{""label"": ""N""}? Wait, let's think.

The segment is",N
and so if you put it on the edge the you would go on the edge of the tube,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and it just it would just sort of it just the edge just goes on,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you will never get it you just crease the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit any category. It",N
the good thing about this is you get feedba feedback s inherent is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""the",N
if you re not doing it properly it wont work,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the segment is about the expected behavior not caused",Be
it will probably it will probably be that if you do it on the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the print head will be close enough to be to the edge of the PCB,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The statement talks about the print head",Be
and you ll lift the whole the whole thing off,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The segment says ""you'll lift",Be
so you probably wont be able to do this this sort of touch towards the edge,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
because the print head the resistors are in,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
PCB yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""PC",N
just the kind of thing that you could do,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment describes a function or purpose.
</think>",F
with the erm styling,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so it just feels right you not do you are limited to what you can do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if you put your fingers in the wrong place,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think><think>
Alright, so I need to label",N
and if we cut all that for I mean this version,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
it could be much chunkier,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I think that's the correct approach. Let's",N
and this thing could go in the hole this lot could go in the hole,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and perhaps you can mirror it so it works for left handed people as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but you could just make a hole to hold it in either way,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the description is about the structure of the object",S
you d have to certainly with the first go realize where to put their fingers,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Reasoning: The segment mentions ""have to",Be
it might not even work,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if one of their fingers is not in the right hole,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
also you feed it back to the wrist,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is all different things,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah hand sizes as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, but the segment is ""yeah hand sizes",N
you know you could you feed it back,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so its kind of like a watch or something on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment describes something",S
well you could have a battery pack in that could not you,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment mentions a battery pack,",S
or a rucksack,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment is describing a structure, specifically a",S
or a rucksack laugh,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
laugh ghostbusters,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because 'laugh' is an action or function",F
write battery pack on wrist,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
write mould the unit to right position for,D,"{""label"": ""S""}  
But wait, let's think again.

The",S
if you have got if you have got a switch there there there and there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Because the segment is unclear, vague, or irrelevant",N
draw Document E1_4Sketcjjpg crosses indicate position of switchs,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure of the document,",S
and it only works if all four switches are down,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function or purpose of the",F
and those switch positions guarantee that the head is down then,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah that is the control approach is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment is asking whether the control",F
yeah that is the yeah and you design it in such a way that,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the text mentions ""design it in such a",Be
that is a reasonably comfortable position,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""that",N
and if you don t put it in that position,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it does not work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it d be nice though if you naturally pick it up and it works,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah but that is you can do the two together can you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the other thing to to think about is in almost all cases when I look at pens the apart from re wired sort of micropens,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
the th tip is actually the narrowest part of the product,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment describes a structural part of",S
whereas in what we re looking at it could actually be as wide or wider,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so its more like a paintbrush is not it like a DIY paintbrush,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it s more like a roller like a roller yeah,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because it's describing the structure of something,",S
its there is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you had like if you if you had it connected to one side like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't clearly fit into any category",N
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure of the document.",S
or a it would be here the print head you could have then going to there then going to there is,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw Document E1_17 Flipchartjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
that you don t smudge it,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
it would have flexibility because of the metal on which it s hinged if you like,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  
Explanation: The segment mentions 'because of',",Bs
yeah I think actually I wonder if you intuitively know how to use a roller,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
because you re older than eleven and intuitive if you have never seen it before,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
my two year old rolls paints,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} // placeholder
I need to analyze this segment:",F
but I think it could be the pen I mean it could be we could shape it so it does make it like a finer tip,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}",Bs
yeah but there is an inherent size issue with holding it this way is not there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
because you re not going to have you you you used to have these pens that were ginormous and,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it had lots of different pens inside it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure of the container,",S
yeah and they re all like this round,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and it made it really difficult to write with at the right angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}  
I think the segment is about difficulty in writing",N
so I think there is an issue about how big or how,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

But why? Because the segment is ""so",N
big,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment ""big"" is a vague adjective",N
you might not hold it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit any category. It",N
yeah I think that is worth considering it actually,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
the not having it in a pen shape,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
the not holding it like a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but actually holding it in a different way like that or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah there are two there are two sides to this I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
either you want to teach children to hold a pen properly,F,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function/purpose of teaching",F
if you wanted to do that you d give them a,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let's break this down. The segment",N
yeah but you have got to be taught how to hold a pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
a lot better as write like this as well,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  # because it's about the function of writing",F
different people will write,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
- The segment is about",N
with not smudging the ink,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
different people will hold the pen between these two fingers and write like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure of how the pen",S
they should not be allowed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to determine the label for the segment """,N
is it a training aid or toy that we re is it for fun,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is asking whether",F
its for fun,F,"{""label"": ""F""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""its",F
its mainly really for fun really I think erm,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
Explanation:
- The segment is a statement of purpose",F
because if you want to teach a child something about pens,F,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function of pens, which",F
you d give them a pen would not you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
no well it depends it could be funit could teach you something,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
an added bonus I suppose,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""an",N
it could teach you something else,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
its going to be quite a fat lump probably,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so it s not going to be that kind of pen that you use in future,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so it does not feel much like a pen,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you know it could I think it could be more of a decorator s thing you know,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if you want to put a row of smilies in,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
paper and pen along the edges of you know,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
on the wall,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Because the segment ""on the wall"" doesn't",N
you re never gonna draw a whole pic you re never gonna draw paint the Sistine chapel,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
no you d need more batteries,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Because the segment ""no you d need more batteries",N
its more of sort of decorative kind of features,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
things like that you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
there is another degree of freedom to this thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if you go fast it will be a paler colour,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The segment is describing the expected behaviour",Be
if you go slowly it will be darker wont it,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""if",Be
yeah if you go fast well maybe if you go fast if there is no feedback from the paper it does not matter how fast its going,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
then it might produce gaps but it might produce gaps in places of,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the thing would be cool,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's expressing a desire or potential function of",F
if you drive it faster,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} because it's about performance independent of parts/materials",Be
that mark is the same as that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Wait, let's analyze this segment: """,N
that is what you will end up with but erm you won t end up with a long smooth line erm that is faint erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
definitely gaps in it head on all the time you don t have the head on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah you could turn it off off and on very fast could not we,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} because the segment mentions 'very fast' which relates",Be
for the usefulness er well I am just I am just trying to think about what erm what the pen does really erm,F,"{""label"": ""N""} because the text is vague and doesn't fit into",N
if it s if it s a if its fun its got to do,F,"{""label"": ""N""} because the text is unclear, vague, or off",N
sort of a wider range of features,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment ""sort of",N
features somehow,F,"{""label"": ""N""} because the term 'features' is vague and doesn",N
I think it might self regulate,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} because it's about the expected behaviour without reference to",Be
I think people might visit around how does it work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
or they use it more slowly I think that is,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but I am thinking it will it will be more fun,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""but",N
if you can get something you know if you can get a faint line or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
a faint line,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you had a drawing there that you did was that for any particular purpose,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
```",F
I ve seen a pen that somebody s created,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
where its actually got this kind of loop in it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so that if you hold it with your index finger actually through this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so it s you you almost wear it like a glove,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, why is this labeled as S?",S
deep breath in yeah or like a sort of ring on your finger with the pen attached to it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but it forces you to hold it in a very specific way,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}  
Because the segment describes behaviour caused by structure or",Bs
um that is intriguing sort of like a like a could be like a finger puppet could not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah cos wearing it like a finger puppet,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the feel of it might be fun,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
exactly so you can make you can make the footprints,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the purpose of the footprints",F
I I think I think the sort of design not very good at,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
Tom does that help regulate the angle,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is about the purpose or function of",F
that would also tie in quite well the sort of cyber view,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
of having a pack on your wrist,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure of having a pack",S
or sort of cyber arm is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
thermal print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
lightning coming out of his nose,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
is the issue of left and right handedness erm how we re going to resolve that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
can you turn the print head round or,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
it does not matter because as long as you have got as long as you have got features that can be either mirrored features the same on each side,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you have got them all like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you have got some area to work with and then,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the segment refers to a structural aspect,",S
you have to keep the area of the mirror image,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think><think>
Alright, so I need to figure",F
quite good,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
in fact in some ways we should think about the fact it is not even a pen,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
because a pen you you will always learn to write from left to right whether you re left handed or right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so actually what you end up doing is left handed people is you smudge over over your work which is a problem,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but actually with this you re dragging it you re not pushing it are you most people will drag it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Wait, but why is it N? Let",N
mostly dragging it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
mmm because you were wired to drag it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Because the segment is describing the intended purpose (",Be
will be dragged,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
that is an interesting point,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
mmm so you want a design then to sort of force people to drag,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""so",N
it which is not something you do with a marker pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you draw a line when you drag,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The action of drawing a line is",F
generally you might do with a marker pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}.
</think>

```json
{""label"": """,N
with a marker pen you tend to drag yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but what I am saying is the analogy of teaching people to write is not actually valid in the sense that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

But wait, the segment is talking about an analogy",N
when you re writing you re not actually dragging usually apart from if you re right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if you re right handed you drag,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}  // Because it's about function: using your",F
if you re left handed you push,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment is a statement about left",F
so do they do a left handed version of this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that s more interesting cos commercially lost that would be a loss leader just about,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well it must it must cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is talking about the purpose or goal",F
its gonna cost twice as much,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but schools or something schools must buy two sets,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah its not worth its not really for schools,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well they had that in my school when I was in primary school everybody had a red fountain pen and I had a special green fountain pen because I was left handed,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment describes the structure (materials",S
erm protecting the print head which I haven t really thought very much about,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
but as it it might be a nuisance or bad thing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is a vague opinion, not fitting",N
to have the print head projecting down out of the bottom of this most of the time,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
because it may catch on things like the edge of the table or something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}.
</think>

The segment describes a situation where the",Bs
and so erm perhaps there is something else a rounded lump or something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
as it approaches the page causes the print head to come down,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

I think I need to label this segment as",Be
which may carriage be sprung also,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let's break this down. The segment",N
like a see saw,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
comes down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
like a nodding birds yeah,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if you have your printing head ,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Correct? Let's see.

The segment is",S
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
and you have got you have got your spring like that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's a part name (E1_",S
and you have got a switch or something here ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, why? Let me think.

The",N
and you have got a case there ,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is '",N
draw E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment is about the structure or part of",S
and then when you you can only push this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and then when you push this up so that all the faces are touching,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
The segment describes the action of pushing",S
that is when the switch goes,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
erm so you get so so what this is is is maybe this is not erm err susceptible to knocks and things because its on a sp spring,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}",Bs
yeah and you get protected by a case,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
but the other thing is the opposite of this being here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and these two things being on springs,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
so that when these get pushed back,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Wait, but the segment is ""so that",F
they ll spring back and then they will switch on the,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
that is true that works as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that works even better cos it s not leaking its protected then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Because the segment mentions that something works better because",Be
a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the term 'sheath' refers to a",S
a print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
```",S
yeah do you need to stop the print head going sideways,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

The segment mentions the print head going sideways",Be
draw arrow not sure which drawing,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
cos you want it to travel forwards when its going that direction,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation:
The segment says ""cos you want",Be
yeah you don t want people to go that that that is an interesting point,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
put wheels on the side to make it,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
I I don t think there might not be a problem with that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} (but wait, let's see if it's",N
in fact it might be something that they might want to do to produce interesting effects,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
distorted smiley faces,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

I think the distorted smiley faces are because of",N
and I think we might get away with that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but what if what if a child held the pen can I just borrow that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is asking a",N
rather than holding it width ways,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
so this is across the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing a part of the pen.",S
thinking of holding it that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
providing just enough pressure,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
providing probably be alright,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  # because it's about expected behaviour without reference",Be
but we could try and stop them from doing it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it is sort of like a its like a calligraphy pen is not it if you erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
because you get thick you get thick and thin,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
because you get the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
that business of withdrawing the print head when it s not in use or something like that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well yeah well it s a sheath is not it that is the word you said was not it a sheath that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
a sheaf,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
write sheath protecting the head,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's describing the function of the sheath",F
or it could be deployed on contact or something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
OK it is fundamental the other thing that I am now going to look at is ,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
two two problems one is over pressurising the print head on the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
or abuse of the pen so somebody could go like that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and that will probably break it and,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Alright, I need to figure out the correct",S
does not fix that does it er no the sheath does not fix that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you go like that you hit the printer,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: 'to hit the printer' implies",F
whereas the other way round bangs table,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
well the sheath protect that is not it so,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the sheaths so spring both and the things happen,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}  
I think the user is asking about the she",N
yeah so expect there is more travel if you smash there,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Because the segment is about the expected behavior without",Be
Draw 2 crosses over Tom s sheath Document E1_4 Sketchjpg,D,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

- The segment is about",N
yeah that means you can t move both yeah yeah that is right yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so I its what AJ suggested that this moves back,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
to to start to as a switch,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment is a command or instruction",F
whereas the alternative is for that to move back,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
well I suppose you could design it such a way as it only goes,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
at a certain speed back so if you went if you just went like that it would go back quite,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The segment discusses the effect of speed",Be
slowly but if too quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you you could have them both moving back and,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could have you could balance springs and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could have viscous back,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if that thing s on a spring and that is on a,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
Draw unknown sheet,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
of some sort which could be quite simple,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
viscous,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} because viscous relates to the structure or material property",S
write viscous damper,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is """,S
and if you bang it down its effectively solid,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

The reasoning is that 'cheap' refers to",S
leaking syringe,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Wait, the segment is 'leaking sy",Bs
cheap syringe,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment 'cheap syringe'",S
write leaky syringe,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
where s the sheath gone,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment ""where s",N
heat source,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it refers to the part/material used to generate",S
laser light,S,"{""label"": ""F""}.
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
any other ways in which we could try I mean we could put a cap over it that is how other people do it ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because the segment is giving a suggestion about an",N
that is way too low tech for this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is a negative",N
that will protect it but it still is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is ""that",N
what about a cap,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
like a spring loaded cap,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} because the description is about the structure, specifically a",S
that comes out of the way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let me analyze this. The segment is",N
yeah like a button there,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is """,S
that s nice yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The segment is",N
write sprung loaded cap,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

But wait, why is it 'S'",S
that that slides the,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the button,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
I think that the button is part of the",S
then it could not get lost could it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
mmm it could also turn off the comforting hum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
when you put the cap back on,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
I quite like the idea of a comforting hum,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
a comforting hum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, let's analyze the segment. The",N
write comforting hum,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
when it s working right,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} because it's about the expected behaviour without reference to",Be
what like a sings dum dum dum dum dum dum,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
like rolf harris,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is a name, not a function",N
the cap is quite interesting though,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
because if it hinges that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  // because 'hinges' relates to the",Be
it will make people much more likely to to drag it across there if it s clear as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function of making people more",F
yeah but you can still see things or,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if you had not just an activation button not an,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
activation button but a button that made the print head come out,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} because the button's structure (as a part)",Bs
a non a non clickable pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because 'pen' is a part, so",S
so you had to you know obviously not up there,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is indicating a function or purpose,",F
you can only write when it s up,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the text is unclear and doesn't fit into",N
if you if you go like that it would sort of go out a little bit,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
and then if you push it up it would go out more,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
```",Be
I mean you can still damage it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so it s a it s a dead man s handle for a pen basically,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, why? Let's see.

Looking at",N
write a dead man handle for the pen,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Reasoning: The segment describes a part of",S
you could have a little slider on it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
could it could do this kind of thing round the edge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah yeah and then and then you coul it could just be sprung,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then when you put it down its held open by,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and then any pressure on the tip,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it s more is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you re not going to be using it for hours on end are you,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Step-by-step explanation:  
The segment is",Be
it s for little pieces of,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
I would say long car journeys though,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you could have a and that open up,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
draw,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation: 'Draw' is",S
a little bit annoying on long car journeys laugh,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
you could have a cap that goes like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
draw,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment ""draw",S
and then you could also have the same spring here,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Because the segment describes a part (spring)",S
that any force by a certain amount would force the cap to shut again,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
a double action cap,S,"{""label"": ""S""}.
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
so you button but it s got an override of pressure,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""so",N
on the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation: 
The segment is",S
I am thinking of something a bit like erm the flap on a video tape,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
The segment describes a structure (fl",S
uh huh what the flap,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
like a garage door type of thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah push the button then it goes open,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
write garage door type mechanism,D,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
but that is probably overly complicated,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
garage door,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The term ""garage door""",S
well it could be a roller,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the segment is describing a part of the",S
a roller door,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure (a roller door",S
write roller door,D,"{""label"": ""F""} because it refers to the function of the roller door",F
as you cool that down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah a button here that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
there is a slider that opens the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment describes the structure of the",S
but then regardless of whether you have got the button pressed down or not you press hard and it comes back down,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so it does not matter if you drag it thuds hand on table it ll just,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
or you just keep that button pressed but,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
thud yeah if you re very sort of cover that comes down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
are you just whacking this pen there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear, vague, or off",N
it s got a cap on,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment ""it's got a cap on",F
how much did that pen cost,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is asking about",S
errrr well about five pence or something,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah is that refillable,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Reasoning: The segment ""yeah is that",S
like this is not refillable,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I assume it has a cover that comes on as well,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is nice it s erm holdable,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
so one one pence two pence six pence,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step:

Looking at the segment: """,N
twenty pence,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could put a time delay on it,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the action is about the function of the device",F
that is a good way of protecting it,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
write time delay,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could say it has to be in contact with the paper for a second and then the thing will deployed,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
Step-by-step explanation:
The segment mentions that something",F
that is easy,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment ""that is easy"" doesn't",N
and that way it s protected from being banged,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
is there is there an issue anyway erm guys with there being or having to be or a benefit by having like a stand by mode,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so its either completely switched off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
with or without the cap on it,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing a part or structure without any",S
or there is like a stand by mode,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
where its sort of semi warm but its ready for action quickly,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
it has a home so a docking station,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is about",S
we could charge it in there as well plus,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it might be over budget,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah so a docking station what would the docking station look like charge,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment is asking about the structure",S
write docking station cradle,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, but 'docking station cradle",S
well it would just be a cradle,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Because the segment is a description of a structure",N
it would just be somewhere for it to live when you re not using it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
like a little protector like an inkwell,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment ""like",S
laugh like a quill,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
Explanation: The segment 'laugh like a qu",F
a quill that means it s not something that you could put in your pencil case,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well I think there is an issue actually there,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
as well with children sometimes using lots of types of pens at the same time,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
if you had erm written something or smudged something with some other type of err pen or even a,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment discusses smudging",N
pencil or a crayon or something like that,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
and then you used this on the same paper would it make the print head dirty,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and would there need to be some way of cleaning the print head potentially,F,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
or would it be good to have some way of cleaning the print head,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
like we could have a cap on it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that actually erm sort of goes past it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
is there any danger if you got ink from another pen or paint can it short,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is asking about",N
it would not short it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it would not short it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but it might burn into the head so,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the good thing you could clean this you can get,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
a crayon would be all right because that would melt,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, let's analyze this segment: ""a",N
you can clean it but erm I have got a way of cleaning it with a knife,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but paint would be a problem would not it you d imagine that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could clean it off but you could not get the kids to do it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
unless you er unless you did it automatically,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit into any category.",N
I mean if you leave the top off that for twenty minutes it dries out,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yes we could just up the age limit it s not a problem,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
write cleaning mechanism,D,"{""label"": ""S""} because 'cleaning mechanism' refers to the structure",S
OK want to do some more detail a bit more mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is about the function or purpose of",F
well we we have got various things haven t we,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

we just have to contact it,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
pressure contacts,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because ""pressure contacts"" is a part of",S

how hot,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but 'how hot' is a",N
how hot does it get,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

{""label"": ""N""}",N
err it does get quite hot well,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  // because 'get quite hot' is expected",Be
the tiny dots can get quite hot,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

if you wear it on your skin it would just be,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
we need to test this but I,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, why? Let's think step by step",N
mechanically the the,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well there is potential for a safety issue,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
but erm where you re going trying to detect a cooling rate from the media,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
that you have been in contact with can be a very hard thing to do erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
but detecting the media or detecting that you re on some kind of media,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or holding station or something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
cos it could be sold as it could be a thing you put your special media on or,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
and we could either detect that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
or we could look for erm translucent dots buried in the erm media or something,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
write translucent dots,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The term 'translucent dots'",S
or you could they you could a they could be like er beads switches,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you can only write on a magnetic plate is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is: """,N
yeah you could do that or looking for a signal or,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or detecting a change,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so this is what you re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
errr yeah its more systemy,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I guess beyond the actual pen you could imagine all sorts of systems where,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
mmm ok you re tied you re tied to the media anyway so it s not really,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
erm yeah you re probably not constrained,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
because you unless you are detecting something special about the media which you might want to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, let me think again. The segment",N
the effects of the media then it would work on any thermal media or,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is not common is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
like printers,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because 'printers' is a part or",S
fax machines,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because 'fax machines' is a noun phrase",S
I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the mechanism might look like,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because I don't see any of the categories fitting",N
the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because the segment is vague, an opinion,",N
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I think I'll have to go through each label",N
well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear, vague, or off",N
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}",F
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

---

Segment:
The feed roller is made of hardened",N
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

I'm trying to figure out the label for this",N
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
and then they could stay,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
do they really need to stay in contact well,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
edge and if you go over it if you come too high an angle,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

But let's think about this segment: """,N
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
but what you cant do is it can t the print head can t tilt back or forward because these slots are in,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
Explanation: The segment discusses the print head's",Bs
they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The segment is",N
this this stays at a fixed angle,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The phrase ""this this stays at",S
it can move up and down,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} because it's describing expected behaviour without reference to specific",Be
and side to side its fixed that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the print head relative to the pen,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Correct answer: S  
Explanation: The segment",S
I am sorry I am just thinking about I think there is probably a geometry that could do it with just one switch erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
that when you come too far over erm the pen starts moving back in and so back in,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and therefore the switch comes off,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the switch comes off implies its function or purpose",F
before it looses contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the outside bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because 'the outside bit' refers to a part",S
yeah the thing that we did a few years ago,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
which had a kind of sort of forced balanced print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to analyze the segment: ""which had",N
we tend to do fairly wide print heads,S,"{""label"": ""S""}",S
to try and keep them in contact with the medium,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, let me think. The segment is",S
it appears a bit different less controlled,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and on that we basically had a frame,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
which brought the print head down brought the print head down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}  
But the user says: ""Wait, the",N
and then that is right and so,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
like this and then,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it s like the old tape recorders is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it finds its own level,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's indicating a function of the system.",F
and the force is applied to this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
that is right the print head just like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
on a carrier as well,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
could it work this way as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
no,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is the word",N
what you always want to combine is something that when you press you press media,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment talks about",S
so that you have made contact,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
circuit you over pressurise it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and it goes past it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so it does not work and then you have got you have got bottom out,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
sheath here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Because ""sheath here"" is unclear and",N
brilliant idea,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and could you use these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and put them in 3D,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it refers to the structure of the object in",S
could be one could be one here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
we only need two in the front and back,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so that as well as being in the right vertical position ie actually touching paper,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Because the label 'Be' is appropriate as",Be
so that it dissipates heat not press too far,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}",F
because then it pops out the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",Bs
and you re over pressurising it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but also something to do with the fact that these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
if if as you say go over an angle then you notice that central thing comes away from one side,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you know the distances between the edge of these ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the distance between the edges of these things and the outer casing,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
when you re at a small angle,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
they move a little bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}

Explanation:
- The segment is describing how something moves",Be
when you re at a big angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
one sides hard up against it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
the other one produces a gap and so you can almost have that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
could you have that front and back as well like a sort of cross,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is asking",S
and then you have to have all four things contacted like what you said earlier so,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Wait, but according to the guide, the",N
if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the instruction is to draw four contacts with compliance",F
because they re on a spring and then you have got your central four points,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
here this is going to be up then if you go in that planeover an angle too much ,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
my arg what I was trying to say before is erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
you could do it with one switch,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment suggests a method or function (""could",F
if if the casework say the casework is comes out f further out errm ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is: """,N
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
- The segment is """,N
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment describes the function of the switch.",F
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Step-by-step explanation:
The segment discusses contact",Be
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment talks about the structure or configuration of",S
so that so that when it it does not actually erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

So, the segment is ""so that so",N
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The segment ""don t we have",F
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""all",N
draws,D,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the text refers to a purpose or goal (""",F
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Because it's describing a part (switch)",S
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The segment mentions 'be able to",Be
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is a statement",N
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, the segment says ""allows that has",S
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
Because the segment is vague and unclear, not fitting",N
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Because the segment is talking about the structure (",S
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is vague and doesn't fit any",N
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment indicates a purpose or goal ('to",F
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because the action is about function. It's turning",F
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the statement is vague and lacks any specific information",N
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""I",N
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Step-by-step explanation:
The segment describes the",Be
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to assign a label to the segment """,N
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: The segment discusses the expected behavior of",Be
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""so",N
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
- The segment is a",N
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think><think>
Okay, so I'm trying to",F
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is vague, unclear, and doesn",N
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""just",N
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to think about this segment: ""and",N
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""F""} — because it's about the function of the edge",F
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation: 'vertical' refers to a structural",S
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but the segment is ""on on",N
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Alright, let's analyze the segment ""switch",F
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 
```",Bs
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't fit any",N
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit into any category.",N
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
Because the segment describes a situation where two things",N
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure (parts) without",S
but if its too far out it wont be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
because its erm not touching,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment talks about",S
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
理由：The segment mentions that it won't",Be
because they don t touch this outer angle here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function of the mechanism.",F
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'Sticks rather than springs'",Bs
you could just stick it on a on a rubbery pack or a film,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
sketching spring,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because 'sketching spring' is a",S
I er,D,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
they start doing this sheath that hits first,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""N""}.
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation:
The segment is describing the function of",F
so you can t do it quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
so you can t shock that thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Explanation: The segment is instructing someone to",F
that ll slo slow down and then it will slowly move back,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
```",F
yeah but then when you erm take it off the paper it quickly pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""Be",Be
because this is a one way valve,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 
Because the segment is describing the expected behaviour of",Be
just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing a part of the structure,",S
they will be air in there,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
so that spring quickly returns it back down to it s protective position,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Wait, let me think through this again.",Be
so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
but as soon as you take it off it pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
so its just good point actually clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I was just thinking that relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
so if we moves it round masks speech contact with the surface,S,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
its going to have quite a bit of momentum still so erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
quite hard or something that its pressed onto,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because it's unclear and vague. It doesn't",N
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is """,F
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Because the segment is indicating a function or purpose",F
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and then sort of smash onto something,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's a structural component without implying function or",S
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment 'protected the bottom bang",F
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to figure out the correct label for the",N
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah its not going to be anything like this heavy is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
no well as I say you need to shock that down ,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

I need to see why that is. The",F
you re smash you re gonna smash the edge of this protective sheath before this does anything in here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah also they re not that made out of ceramic and glass,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
The segment talks about the materials (",S
mmm I think that is I think that the other other protective thing,F,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
is whether they smash it off the table before momentum,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""is",N
It s not it s not really kids sort of erm err throwing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it down its also people dropping it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't fit any category. It",N
yeah if they bang it into concrete really hard,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah but as I was saying if it was spring loaded,S,"{""label"": ""N""}  
But I think it's more like 'S",N
then you can smash the edge of this,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
cos this is as soon as the force gets to here this is inside it so,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
or whatever that we could perhaps achieve holding this thing flat to the surface,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the foam pads is an idea actually you could imagine,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I think I should try to get my hands on",N
a foam pad with an aluminium carrier on the front of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
and the print head fastened to that,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Because the segment describes a part (print head",S
and it can just squidge around,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
so yeah that would work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it would also give you some a really cheap way,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
of achieving a reasonable force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment ""of achieving",F
a great density foam,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's a description of the material/structure",S
that could give you the force of the print head,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because it's about the function of the print head",F
it could just recoil far enough it s a good idea actually,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that could work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
a big sponge,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing the structure of the sponge,",S
draws,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, why is 'draws' labeled",S
aluminium print head on the bottom all connected,D,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Explanation: The segment describes the structure (materials",S
I reck I reckon you move it around,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah well you put this,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and it will just erm you have got spring and you have got some lovely,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
could you even take that one further,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, let's analyze this segment: '",N
like you could build the foam around the print head,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so you d have to press the foam back to actually reveal the print head in the first place,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
so it almost wraps round a little bit,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it describes the structure or configuration of the object",S
so if you go like that bang the foam needs to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
```",F
perhaps not wrapped around to the extend in front of the housing,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Reasoning: The segment talks about wrapping around",S
so that you know you need to press the foam,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} because the cue is ""so that"" which indicates",F
bit in before you actually start touching it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah you need the foam,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
to do some damping,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
so that is got to go somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment is a goal or purpose",F
yeah you need the foam to have tha that sort of this sort of,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
where where it does not want to move fast,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
Explanation: 'Does not want to move fast",Be
well has to be down,S,"{""label"": ""N""} (but need to think why)

Wait, the",N
we could we could have some sort of air bladder,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
I think it probably could be rubber,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Wait, but why? The segment is stating",S
obviously,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah the stuff they make wrist supports for erm,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment is talking about the structure (materials",S
like the jelly stuff,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Wait, but the segment is ""like the",N
yeah the gel,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is 'yeah",N
yeah well gel does that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah techno gel,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the only p gel,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the segment 'the only p gel'",S
we ve talked a little about air cushions,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
and the sort of syringe type mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment is describing the structure of",S
any other ways that we could use sort of air pockets of some sort to,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you could make a magnetic force it in the middle,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
pellets,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Reasoning: 'Pellets' refers to",S
so it stays sort of stays,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}.

Wait, let me think. The segment is",N
pushed into it yeah you could do something like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
magnets not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, let me think again. The segment",N
air pockets are much cheaper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well that does not have to be that could be a balloon inside,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah you could put a it on a pneumatic bladder in,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah or like a sort of bridge,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
or you could do what they do in an old fashioned mouse not optical mouse,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

The segment is discussing an",N
with the b ball,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's a part of the structure.

Wait",S
just use gravity because it s own weight makes it roll on the mouse mat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, is that correct? Let me see",N
that would work,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}  // because it's a suggestion, implying a",F
five hundred grams is that wh is that the,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

I need to figure out the correct label for the",N
oh you need five hundred grams OK that is fi,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't match any",N
you need five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it specifies a quantity, which falls under Structure",S
how far s five hundred grams,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
er er yeah if you take it to twenty mill,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Explanation: The segment is vague and doesn't fit",N
sort of half the compression that will be,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
I did not realise what this was this is a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it s a prototype model,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because 'prototype model' is a description of",S
it s not really a prototype,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well its test,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
to explore,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, why did the segment ""to explore""",N
why do you need that force,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The segment is asking about the purpose",F
err expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but the user has provided an example",N
for contact is it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
well if you well if you well if you have got heat here,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and here its zero contact is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
yeah so you need quite a strong contact basically,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Explanation: The segment is a vague statement without clear",N
well if you have got a so if you go to ten mils instead of five,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment is unclear and doesn't fit any",N
well then you re going to have a,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
a switch on,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, the segment is ""a switch on"".",N
that is what one of the questions was the other switch goes past there we want to wa,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
one you re inside the protective thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
two it s not got power,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
this is really difficult is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
yeah it will be like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 
Because the segment is vague, lacks specific information",N
but its very similar,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it s just for the skilled personnel to use in their lab,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment mentions '",F
the print quality in a way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Reasoning: The phrase ""in a way",F
what is the range of angles,Be,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
it s just to measure what you what the parameters are,S,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is about the purpose of measuring parameters",F
if you like it s just its just to give us some guidance,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
so what we re talking about is is err where rather than having that as the range of movement,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
we re talking about having a thing like a spring which,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  
Because the segment is describing a structural component (",S
like a millimetre or so,S,"{""label"": ""S""} because it's describing a structure, specifically a measurement",S
yeah yeah but then you have got to stop stop further down,S,"{""label"": ""N""} because the text doesn't fit into any category.",N
yes from what we were talking about its actually the moving bit,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
it s actually much easier because this bit you have got the moving bit,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that affects position,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
what we re really talking about is that the print head will be struck,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
that is easier to use,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but let's think. The segment",N
yeah to make this to make this the same,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""F",F
you d have to you d have to extend a cylinder over this thing,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
```",F
and then the and then the cylinder would come to a stop,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
yeah and so its going to be a much more compact version of that,S,"{""label"": ""F""}",F
where it will only move maybe a couple of millimetres erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} because the segment is describing a structural aspect without implying",S
and then it would be an outer casement,S,"{""label"": ""S""}  // because it's describing the structure
```",S
so you could continue to drag the along,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}
</think>

{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
still get a sense of the force,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
actually five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Because the weight is being specified, so it",S
that means this sort of thing is not going to work,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
oh no it means this has got to be more than five hundred grams to push that back,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""}
The label for the segment is 'S' because",S
if you had a sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",S
you have to press that has to be more than fi ou,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}  
But why? Because the segment says ""you",F
have to make it come back,Be,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
and provide an extra five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is asking",S
it depends what the sheath is doing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} because the segment doesn't clearly fit into any category",N
if the sheath has if the sheath has a sprung sheath,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:

1. **Analyzing",N
then you have got to overpower that and,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""}  
I think the key here is to look for",Be
another five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
</think>

{""label"": ""S""}",S
erm but most the value in the sheath,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
``` 

Alright, I need to figure out",S
might be to protect against kind of catching sideways edges and things,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}",Bs
it does not work this sheath does it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
well it does work but it just means you got to press harder does not it,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} because the segment is stating the function of the product",F
well only if its yeah but does it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""S""}.
</think>

```json
{""label"": """,S
provides the spacing,S,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""S",F
yeah it does not have to be heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, the segment is ""yeah it does not",N
five hundred grams is not very much,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
is there five hundred grams,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
Step-by-step explanation:
- The segment is a",S
well is there anything else,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
quite a lot erm it is a lot is a lot for a pen,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Reasoning: The segment describes the quantity of",S
that is true,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
and then you have got all the batteries,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
you could just make the make the whole thing a kilogram in weight,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{
  ""label"":",N
five hundred grams for the whole thing laugh,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
the shape of it,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is """,S
cos can you press with a pen five hundred grams easily,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
you can press twenty mils now,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}
</think>

{""label"": ""F""}",F
yeah that is twenty mils up,S,"{""label"": ""S""}
```",S
yeah but if its out of the ring out of the ring like Tony was saying,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
```",N
its apparently easier,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, but why is ""apparently"" there",N
and the its not tha yeah its just like you said its just holding it is not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

{""label"": ""N""}",N
it will pay for itself that kind of thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, why? Let's see.

The",N
in this direction,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

Wait, the segment is ""in this direction"".",N
it depends a lot on the friction between the print head and the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Wait, but the segment is talking about friction",N
it depends on the weigh the weight of the thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
cos that makes it really hard,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}

Step-by-step explanation:
The segment is ""cos",N
if its straight down then and deals with the print head,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 
(But let's see why.)

Looking at",S
if we push down like this,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
to force to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  // because it's a function: to keep",F
you have got to you have got to keep the paper still,S,"{""label"": ""F""}  
Explanation: The instruction is to keep paper still",F
the friction between this and this that holds that,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 
But why? Because the segment is vague and",N
yeah that is true yeah the friction will be about a third,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}  // because it's talking about the purpose or",F
or something at least one hundred grams one hundred grams of paper across the table,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 
Explanation: The segment describes a structure: paper",S
so if this is maybe a kind of a book,S,"{""label"": ""N""}
</think>

```json
{""label"": ""N",N
