what s quite important is its about the thermal incli inclis pen,F,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:'s' is a definite article",S
but its also about the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text mentions media, which is",N
so its the interaction between the special paper and the thermal pen basically ok,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
but I know quite a lot of the briefing openly focuses about the print and things like that and obviously that is a key aspect of the brainstorm,F,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes how the briefing openly",Bs
but we should also not forget that the paper is involved in all of this as well,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The paper is a material involved in",S
the one on the top left is the one that is the real main,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text suggests the top left one",F
focus of the of what we re doing today,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment does not clearly fit any",N
that is the standard plain thermal paper err and then it can draw,F,"{""label"": ""Be""}


Segment:
the paper is used for printing documents",Be
its either atoms or line types er,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Note: This answer is not wrong, but",N
so for the process of making this prototype that is going to help us sell the project that is the concept really err design a a prototype umm,F,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
the other ideas on the paper there were other concepts for a thermal pen which erm may form the ultimate product,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes a product and ideas",N
but are not what we re going to prototype first,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text is irrelevant to the prototype",N
erm so we may want to talk about those later,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide a segment and the corresponding JSON answer",N
as a sort of broader,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment: as a sort of narrower

Explanation: The word'spectrum' does",N
spectrum but the main focus is that style pen,F,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
where you will create a set of patterns by moving on plain white paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: This segment describes a behaviour that is",Bs
will this be in colour,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The paint is transparent but still very",N
yeah well we should the impetus for this is that erm clients come up with this new rainbow media,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and we can print thermo reactive dyes onto er,F,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
media substrates and then when you heat them up they cool to reach the colour they re supposed to be,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so erm we have done some test prints on this erm been tested by the HP boss,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment does not clearly fit any",N
and playing with erm hot air miraculously a colour image appears erm out of a blank sheet of paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Please explain the segment in the context of the",S
so providing we could provide a heat source,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 
Note: The answer is F because the segment",F
then we could reveal anything which is printed on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation:
The segment implies the purpose/goal",F
now erm technically that is more demanding,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: Although the text contains the word '",N
because energising the entire printout takes time,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please let me know if you would like me",N
hammers the batteries and its quite a demanding thing to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so technically the stuff where you have got a low percentage fill sort of faces and text and things like that is a lot more realisable,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please follow the same format for the following segments",N
but if we could do that with the media,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The label 'N' is chosen",N
whether we could do that with this adaptation I don t know,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please note that the text does not provide a",N
the one on the right the one on the right does not actually have to be a thermal pen it could just be,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Note: The answer is not 'N'",N
it could be a soldering iron,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
or a hot air,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
but basically th the focus is on that at the moment and basically th the idea is that there is a thermal print out in in the nib of the pen,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Note: The label 'Bs' stands for",Bs
whichever shape that takes now with that concept,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The text does not describe a function",N
there are a number of specific problems that need to be overcome,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Please explain your choice of label.
The label",F
so basically the first problem that we need to think about is the wobbly arm movement of the users,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
this is aimed at potentially but not exclusively at five to eleven years olds,F,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation:
The segment describes the target audience,",Be
who have some writing skill but not fantastic writing skill they re likely to hold the pen different ways errm different angles etcetera and,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence contains a specific behaviour (",Bs
so ther there is two important things,Be,"{""label"": ""<your chosen label>""}

Note: This is a pilot version",N
one is with respect to that in this concept one is that that the printout needs to stay in contact with the thermal print paper to actual print,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes the expected behaviour of",Be
so there needs to be this contact maintained,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text states a purpose or goal",F
and the other thing is the printout needs to stay in the right angle to print as well,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Segment:
The material of the pen is a",Bs
so we need to think of designs that actually erm help to do that,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
The system is supposed to be able",F
even though the user is not capable of keeping exactly the right shape or weight,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The user is unable to keep the",Be
is to come up with some ideas as to other products or situations where a product,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
to be made of a material that",F
needs to follow a contour,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
or needs to be able to adjust itself keeping itself in the same alignment,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Note: The answer is Be because the segment",Be
even thought the user might be moving things about did anybody come up with any ideas on that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment is irrelevant to the task",N
is it only paper you re thinking about or could it be other things like mugs or fabric or pottery,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide more examples.

Here are some examples",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide the text: 
it could be",N
it could be anything,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment is unclear and does not",N
yeah I guess it could be all those,S,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
The paper is too big for the",N
I ended up with the hold on sledge,S,"{""label"": ""S""}


Segment:
The new 3D printer has",S
the sledge excellent,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
write sledge,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so what did that generate then,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please let me know if this is correct or",N
the sledge manages to keep level,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text describes the behaviour of the",Bs
by having quite a wide base,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the physical property of",S
write wide base,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
a main force in the middle,BS,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
unlike the set of skis,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment doesn’t fit into any",N
where quite narrow and you go up on an edge when you re turning,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
This sentence describes a behaviour that is",Bs
the sledge is er quite broad,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Segment:
the pen is very smooth

JSON",S
and then you have the weight right in the middle so they manage to keep both runners on the snow,BS,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Segment:
The printer has a good reputation for",Bs
write force in middle,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
more often than say a sledge or a snowboard a skis or snowboard,S,"{""label"": ""Be""}


Segment:
the way you would describe a snow",Be
so so would you potential see some some some guiders almost down the side of this,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment is irrelevant and does not",N
well I guess the easiest way to keep the pen at a right angle would be,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
to have a set of stabilisers on it,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
based on the idea of a sledge,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the structure of the",S
yeah no problem stabilisers like a bicycle yeah that is a good idea,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:'stabilisers' implies that",Bs
write stabiliser,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
I was thinking that is sort of maybe like a flat base with a sort of universal joint like a windsurf mast,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Please provide the explanation for the label you chose",Bs
yeah write Universal base ,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
if the is like this it stays flat but the bit you hold onto can be at,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text describes a behaviour (st",Bs
different angles,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
I guess the size of the thing in contact with the paper you could either have a very small contact area,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Please note that the description is not in the",S
and er track where it goes or you can have a wide contact area,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Explanation: 'wide contact area' is a",Bs
show the relative size of the pen clears throat if you have got an example because that is,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
look at the end of that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment is unrelated to the purpose",N
size is dictated by cost really it needs to be quite narrow,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
I imagine it to be that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The label 'N' is chosen",N
could be a that way,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text describes a possible state or",N
lets just use that as guidance but let us,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Please provide your answer as per the provided guidelines",Bs
tip of that,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
rather than the rest I would suggest,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Explanation:
The 'rather than' phrase indicates",Bs
it can be te ten mil across,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it s a erm its not an edge one then it s a it s a on the flat there,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
are two flats printing are not there more than one,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment is vague and does not",N

JSON answer: {""label",N
while drawing if I where yeah the resistors sit on the lump there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes a specific condition that",Bs
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 1,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and you have got the type where the resistors sit on this corner here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Please explain your choice.
The segment describes the",Bs
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg top 2,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: 'it s a corner one'",N
it s a corner one,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
no its not cheap,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Note: The label set also includes 'D",N
it ll be about fifty percent more expensive,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text states a purpose/goal",F
yes this there is an end,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment clearly describes a physical entity",S
there is an end that goes over the paper is not there is sort of thing,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text does not describe a part",N
there is a type that does this as well though,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment clearly does not fit into",N
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle overlap left,D,"{""label"": ""S""}


Explanation:
The segment describes the position of an",S
but they type that we have got is like this but in actual fact its much more biased towards the edge,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment talks about how the text",Bs
so you normally have a a slight angle here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the angle caused by",Bs
right so easiest thing obviously draws on flip chart,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'flip chart' is a specific",Bs
yeah the the typically what you do is you have got foil going over and,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text describes the expected behaviour of",Bs
you get quite a lot you know you can have quite a lot of angle there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'angle' is explicitly caused by",Bs
draw angle,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so we were talking mostly about that one or that one,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment is irrelevant, as it",N
that one sort of plus or minus,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment doesn’t match any of",N
all these you have to keep flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Segment:
This is the part that you have",Bs
its just its just whether we need flat or long,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text does not describe a function",N
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
The segment is describing the structure of",S
both axes,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
yeah I think we do well we need guidance on both axes whichever way,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The sentence does not describe a function",N
you do it I think,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text does not describe a function",N
you have like you have like a hot ball a hot ball like a ball point pen,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
The hot ball is like a hot",Bs
draw circle draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
The label S is chosen because the",S
and then you had a tracker like an optical mast then,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Reasoning: The tracker was like an optical",Bs
draw box draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg middle,D,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
- The segment is a description of",S
I think that picture where you re moving a pen across the paper in sort of patterns repeating patterns,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
instead of doing it all in one go like a wide printer would do it will just do a thin line at a time,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text mentions that the printer will",Bs
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
but when you scribble backwards and forwards it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The 3D printer has a",N
would build up and use that tracking capability to do that,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text states a purpose/goal",F
draw refE1_15 Flipchartjpg bottom,D,"{""label"": ""N""}


Explanation: The text is irrelevant to the task",N
and you would not have the angle problem,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment implies that the pen has",Bs
yeah the problem is that printing on the ball,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
we thought the ball could just be you could just sort of turn it off and on,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The segment is an example of a",N
so its like instead of being a unclear speech overlapping thing,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please select one of the following options:

A",N
there is a bit of that OK,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: 
Segment is describing the presence of",S
well I suppose you could make the width of the print very very small,S,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
The feed roller is very stiff.",N
we ve done that ,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment clearly does not fit any",N
we did that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: No clear purpose/goal (F",N

you heat them up very very briefly and then,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: This segment describes the behaviour of heating",Bs
they ll go cold again,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
probably why you get spots appearing on the second one erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Note: The answer is ""N"" because",N
but you can make it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
The sentence describes a change in behaviour",Bs
clears throat erm at the moment what we have got available for a demonstrator is one of the types on the left,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The text is not describing a part",N
so we do have this constraint of what that angle needs to be ,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text describes a constraint on the",F
so that is going to,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
that angle here,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Note: The label 'D' is not",S
yes that is going to limit us for the time being,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please review the text to determine the label.",N
we could open up more options by going for alternatives,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The sentence suggests that going for alternatives",Be
or whatever that would be good so you just mentioned how windsurfs have sort of a base,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: This is the behaviour from structure,",Bs
to keep the to hold on to rather than actual hands are stabilised like a platform,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N

Explanation: The segment describes the expected behaviour of",Be
and similar to the windsurf,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
I mean it only moves in one axis,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Please provide the segment description and the corresponding JSON",S
rather than round,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it does not its almost flat is not it I suppose,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please follow the labelling guidelines. 
If",N
yeah it does not move that way I do not think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The sentence is expressing a negative opinion",N
cos you want to keep flat on the paper all the time,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
does the razor stay flat though,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
because the centre piece is much,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
I am not sure whether it does completely stay flat I think there might be a little bit of a plain,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide your label for the following segments:",N
but its main axis is is that the razor has is that way I think,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
The razor's blade is very sharp",N
write razor,D,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
if I if I remember correctly from I don t know about this but from the other razors each blade has like a little spring down each side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Please explain the text.

I have brought some examples along there is one with a single spring in the centre there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The word ""spring"" in the",Bs
and then there is one,S,"{""label"": ""<your label>""}

Do not forget to follow the guidelines.",N
these are electric ones yeah,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:

that are electric razors and so",F
slightly more expensive version that is got a spring either side,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
yeah to give you that adjustment it slides on the surface,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes how the pen slides",Bs
they do yeah there is its one with the foils basically because on this the foil is sprung this one is well no,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
the foil will run through rubbers and it uses the the cutting edge that is sprung,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
erm there is a point here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide the segment with the corresponding label and",N
as well that erm do we need to keep because this will keep an even well a relatively constant pressure won t it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: 
The text contains a mix of",N
and you could also you could add a switch to this,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The segment does not describe a clear",N
so you could switch it on and off,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Segment:
This paper is not intended to be",F
yeah but I think there are other things that we might like to do as well because,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it might control the force on the print heads and make sure it comes on how you want it to,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The label is 'F' because",F
so is that what you call a gimble,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
gimbles are normally three dimensional,S,"{""label"": ""S""}

Segment:
A new material is being developed to",N
but as well its erm one of the things about this is that you have got the main lump,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and then you have got steering piece towards the front which is banging near microphone drowns speech,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment is describing a behaviour that",Bs

and you immediately think about something that is this sort of shape that you can hold in your hand like that,Bs,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
The sentence describes the shape of an",S
but considering we re talking about toys in effect for children,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide the ""for children"" segment.",N
could it be something that takes more of the shape of a of a train with,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Please let me know if this is correct or",S
something else that gets pulled behind it for example,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: There is no clear purpose, expected",N
like a drag on,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
something that is much more of a quite a different shape that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

holding the pen at the right angle,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
that is probably one of the things you want to teach a child though is not,F,"{""label"": ""N""}

so if we had something like that,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you could steer this angle of the pen as it moves to the other end,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:'steer' is a behaviour",Bs
its taken us probably three places we can go we can either well its something you control,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N

- 'or' and 'holding",S
cos it could be sold as it could be a thing you put your special media on or,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment describes a hypothetical product and",N
and we could either detect that,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text describes a possibility, an",N
or we could look for erm translucent dots buried in the erm media or something,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please explain the segment and the chosen answer.",N
write translucent dots,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'translucent dots' indicates a",Bs
or you could they you could a they could be like er beads switches,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
- 'or you could they you",Bs
you can only write on a magnetic plate is not it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Segment:
The steel barrel adds weight, so",N
yeah you could do that or looking for a signal or,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
or detecting a change,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation:
This is a behaviour label because it",Be
so this is what you re talking about,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
errr yeah its more systemy,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Note: The label ""N"" is used",N
I guess beyond the actual pen you could imagine all sorts of systems where,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The segment is vague and does not",N
mmm ok you re tied you re tied to the media anyway so it s not really,S,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
this is a very old version of",N
erm yeah you re probably not constrained,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The segment is off-topic and does",N
because you unless you are detecting something special about the media which you might want to do,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please explain the segment.
The segment is describing",N
the effects of the media then it would work on any thermal media or,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Reasoning:
The sentence describes the media's",S
that is not common is it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text does not clearly describe a",N
like printers,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
fax machines,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
I was just going to say yeah I think we should concentrate on what the mechanism might look like,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
the thermal pen cos I think we can spend quite a lot of time,F,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Reasoning: This sentence does not describe a",N
yep so in terms of the actual mechanism we have explored some different angles on that have not we,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please provide the text with the labels added:",N
in terms of the you mean in terms of the spring loading and things like that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The speaker is referring to the behaviour",Bs
well that is one idea and that has the that has a two outer that has an outer limit how far the slider can move,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
that controls there is obviously it stays at an angle until you get to the maximum angle and then if all,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'at an angle' is the",Bs
and then it could switch off could not it,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
- 'and then' is a",N
if it w if it was hitting a certain angle it could switch off,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The text describes a behaviour, but",Be
you d need an additional partner mechanism ,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The additional partner mechanism is a behaviour",Bs
so you could switch you could have that,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you could have the contacts on top and bottom of that piston,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N

do they really need to stay in contact well,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The segment is asking about the purpose",F
if you don t press hard enough then,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

The label for the segment ""if you don",N
edge and if you go over it if you come too high an angle,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}
Explanation: The behaviour described is caused by the edge",Bs
then you do this contact between here and here,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
or you could have the cylinder that moved in some slots,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so that this can move that way,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text describes a purpose/goal",F

they re in a fixed position yeah,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
this this stays at a fixed angle,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it can move up and down,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and side to side its fixed that way,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N

I am sorry I am just thinking about I think there is probably a geometry that could do it with just one switch erm,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text describes a thought process,",N
that when you come too far over erm the pen starts moving back in and so back in,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}


Segment:
The pen was originally made of plastic",F
and therefore the switch comes off,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The segment does not clearly fit any",N
before it looses contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you know it depends on the shape of the case work for it,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Explanation: The sentence describes how the drawing tool",Bs
which brought the print head down brought the print head down,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The sentence is describing a general action",N
and then that is right and so,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
like this and then,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
it s like the old tape recorders is not it,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The text does not describe any physical",N
it finds its own level,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and the force is applied to this,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
that is right the print head just like this erm,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

The segment does not clearly",N
no,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text ""no"" does not",N
what you always want to combine is something that when you press you press media,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

we only need two in the front and back,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment describes a configuration or a",S
so that as well as being in the right vertical position ie actually touching paper,S,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text describes a purpose/goal",F
so that it dissipates heat not press too far,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
because then it pops out the sheath,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N

but also something to do with the fact that these contacts,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment is describing the contacts'",Bs
if if as you say go over an angle then you notice that central thing comes away from one side,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Explanation: The sentence describes a necessary condition for",Bs
if you draw draw four contacts that have some compliance,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes how the drawing is",Bs
because they re on a spring and then you have got your central four points,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N

Explanation: The segment describes a behaviour (cas",Bs
it may or may not work erm clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The text is vague and unclear,",N
if you what it does is you have got one switch that if its but if its on and back i it works,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
but then if you pivot pivot this can pivot a bit but it,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
but it pivots more on the k but the case if you pivot a little bit on the c,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
- 'but it pivots more",Bs
the case comes in contact and it starts to come away,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the effect of the",Bs
it could be shaped so it can only be yeah so,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so that so that when it it does not actually erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}",N
when it does not actually come away its guaranteed that its that its er that its still on the paper,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes a behaviour of the",Bs
don t we have to very much casework,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: 
This sentence does not fit into",N
all I am saying is is is that the if the erm amount of movement is here,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
draws,D,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
draws is a behaviour caused by",Bs
is erm bigger than the amount of movement that erm the case,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
will allow then sort of I am not really sure that you need you need the case at all,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please explain your decision. 

I chose N",N
its just its just sort of I am just worried about this switch is going to have a tolerance factor,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so its going to be er guaranteeing that you switch off when before you come away,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes a consequence of a",Bs
yeah you might get a switch on the side mightn t you,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
because what you want to have happen is,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you need to be able to accommodate more in the mechanism than for contact purposes,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text describes the mechanism's ability",Bs
because what you don t want to have happen is that they come off the print head to come off before,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text mentions what the user does",Bs
yeah but there must be there must be a mechanism that,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Reasoning: The sentence contains the phrase """,Bs
allows that has one switch that says everything that I need all in is in contact,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""}",Be
but what is qui if you wanted to have a certain angle if you if you,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Reasoning: 
The segment does not clearly",N
had the mechanism like that,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes a hypothetical or hypothetical",N
so the actual pen width is so this way right,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
so you write like that but this bit you actually turn that way yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: This is off-topic and doesn't",N
so that means if you write left han right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please see the explanation for the segment above:",N
or if you drag right handed along the paper that way,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes the effect of a",Bs
to be at the right angle and switched on,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you will only need to touch that side,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and it will always be if it s in the right angle,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
it will switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
because it will touch that side,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Note: This is a pilot labelling guide",Bs
if it s on left handed mode ie your,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it would be the opposite side,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The description 'it would be the",S
then you have to switch on that side that switches on for the left handed,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
that is an idea probably for a feature left or right handed mode,F,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: This label describes the structure, specifically",S
is that handed,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: This segment does not clearly describe a",N
well you ll hold it in the opposite way won t you,Be,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Please provide a label for the segment.",F
it depends on how you shape th the product as well,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
The segment describes how the product behaves",Bs
but I think you certainly have to bear it in mind that there is you know,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text is irrelevant to the lab",N
I think I think imagine imagine this was a plot a point some line here,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
if you had to apply some force you could drag by pushing down,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and you could also push by pushing down drag left handed or push right handed,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The text describes how the behaviour of",Bs
followed by a force,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
remember there does not have to be something happening did you say,Be,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
It is known that the plastic container",N
yeah erm the force is not necessarily erm,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The text is irrelevant to the topic",N
but it s,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Please note that I will not provide a solution",S
in that axis is it,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
but it s about it s about the angle being right,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the angle, which",S
switching the if you if you make sure that the angle if the angles in the right way then it switches on,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the behaviour of a",Bs
so it will switch on when its like that I suppose it will still switch on,Be,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the expected behaviour of",Be
when its like that wont it,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
It needs to print legibly at",N
so if that is if you come to a tilt here right then the head can come out ,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you design it so the head,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and its still in contact with the paper,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The part in contact with the paper",Bs
and everything s hunky dory but it has come forward a distance,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation:
- 'and everything' is a",S
and and that can be that can be where it switches off,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the behaviour of the",Bs
and then you can carry on if you carry on with this,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
and this and this is where you know this is where it can t errm accommodate that wrong angle,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
then then its switched off anyway,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment clearly does not fit any",N
just a straight just a straight switch here,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
The segment describes the switch’s straight",Bs
based based on this based on this distance there is a switch here,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
there is a few of those is not there,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The sentence is off-topic (relevant",N
there is a switch there,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'there' is a pronoun",Bs
and then its got a certain travel you know,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
a certain tolerance it works,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
it s it s either on or off between here or here,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Note: This sentence does not describe a physical",N
there is another you could in various ways imagine a sort of disc idea,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please explain your choice of label. 
The",N
which could be anything actually anything fastened to this and rotating,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The label is 'Bs' because",Bs
you just put a window in there somewhere,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment does not match any of",N
and poke a through it in that direction,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Segment:
The final result is the same as",Bs
so one edge defines too far right one edge too far left,S,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The text describes a behaviour, specifically",Be
chop off,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so there is two ideas,S,"{""label"": ""N""}


Segment:
The new design improves the user experience",N
that is that is quite good there is either a mechanical,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
there is there is so there is this is erm so you can switch on erm on the vertical ,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
No clear indication of purpose/goal",N
or switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment does not clearly fit any",N
so there is a minimum travel,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
on on angular,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
switch on and off yeah,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The segment clearly does not fit any",N
could you have the switch between the outer sleeves and this centre bit,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The behaviour (switching between outer",Bs
so if its gone beyond this outer sleeve then it switches off where as if its ,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The segment describes the behaviour of the",Bs
where as its if its too far in its switched off as well,Be,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text does not fit into any",N
so the edges here when they re when they re roughly at the same angle,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please note that the segment is not about edges",N
so when these two are in contact so they re either level or slightly behind it,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Reasoning: The segment describes the expected behaviour",Bs
then they can be on,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""}


Segment:
The paper is a

these erm outer sleeves and if its too far in,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The phrase 'too far in'",Bs
it also wont be working,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text clearly does not fit any",N
because they don t touch this outer angle here,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The sentence is irrelevant to the lab",N
yeah I think there is going to be loads of ways to low cost switch,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The sentence describes a future scenario where",Bs
depend upon final weight of the final mechanism,S,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The text describes a physical property of",S
yeah the point is that you can get away with an on switch,S,"{""label"": ""F""}


Segment:
It is clear that the point is",F
but can we also are there any other ways of floating this head that you can think of perhaps,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
you could stick rather than springs and things,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

they start doing this sheath that hits first,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so th if you fix that sheath onto a plunger that is sprung in a syringe,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: The ""sheath"" is a",Bs
when you push that in you have to push the air like that through a very small hole,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'that in' is a part",Bs
so you can t do it quickly,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so you can t shock that thing,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation: The text does not describe any expected",N
that ll slo slow down and then it will slowly move back,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
yeah but then when you erm take it off the paper it quickly pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 'pings back' is a",Bs
because this is a one way valve,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation:
- 'because' is a '",Bs
just a bit of rubber a flap of rubber,S,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The text does not describe a function",N
they will be air in there,S,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so that spring quickly returns it back down to it s protective position,Bs,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
so bang it down its protected force will come on slowly,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""}",Bs
but as soon as you take it off it pings back,Bs,"{""label"": ""Bs""} 

Explanation: 
- The text states that something",Bs
so its just good point actually clears throat,Bs,"{""label"": ""F""} 

Explanation: The text has the purpose of clearing",F
I was just thinking that relatively the carrier that the print head is on is quite heavy,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Explanation:
The sentence describes the perceived weight of",N

its going to have quite a bit of momentum still so erm,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""} 

Please explain your choice.
The text ""its",N
quite hard or something that its pressed onto,Be,"{""label"": ""S""} 

Explanation: The text describes the property of the",S
yeah it needs to it needs to be protected,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>",N
so it can t travel further forward it can only go backwards,Bs,"{""label"": ""Be""} 

Explanation: The text describes expected behaviour (performance",Be
yeah we don t want it to come off anything,Be,"{""label"": ""Bs""}


Segment:
the result of the pen is a",Bs
or it could hinge forward under its own momentum,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

Explanation: The text does not match any of",N
the only other thing here it s a spring,S,"{""label"": ""Bs""}

The description 'the only other thing",Bs
imagine that is imagine that touches the paper bangs it ,S,"{""label"": ""N""}

protected the bottom bangs twice,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
there is two forces there is not there bangs it,Be,"{""label"": ""<F|Be|Bs|S|D|N>""",N
there is sort of the momentum of the thing itself,Bs,"{""label"": ""N""}
